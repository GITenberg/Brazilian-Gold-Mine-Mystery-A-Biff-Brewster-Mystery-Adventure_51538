<br />Up the Amazon</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Guard this letter as you would your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stannart spoke in a low, tense tone as he
glanced around the waiting room at Idlewild Airport.
Biff Brewster felt a sudden surge of excitement when
he took the envelope that the gray-haired man handed
him.</p>
<p>The envelope was tightly sealed, and it was addressed
to Biff&rsquo;s father, Thomas Brewster, at the Hotel
Jacares in Manaus, Brazil. In the upper corner
was the return address of the Ajax Mining Corporation
in New York City. Gregg Stannart was the president
of the company, and Mr. Brewster was its chief
field engineer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you are flying to Brazil to join your father,&rdquo;
Mr. Stannart continued, &ldquo;I decided to have you deliver
this letter personally, rather than take the risk of
its falling into the wrong hands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>He paused, gave Biff a keen, steady glance, and
asked, &ldquo;Did your father tell you why he was going to
the headwaters of the Amazon River?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wrote that he was going on a jungle safari,&rdquo;
replied Biff, &ldquo;and he invited me to fly to Brazil and
join him, as a birthday present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff was thinking back to his birthday party at the
Brewster home in Indianapolis less than a week ago.
His mother had brought in a cake with sixteen lighted
candles that Biff had blown out with a single puff, to
the delight of the twins, Ted and Monica, who were
five years younger than Biff. But the big surprise was
when Biff&rsquo;s mother had given him the birthday letter
from his dad.</p>
<p>Next had come the excitement of packing, when it
dawned on Biff that nearly all his birthday presents
were clothes and equipment he could use on a tropical
trip. Then Biff had flown to New York where Mr.
Stannart had met him to put him on the plane for
Brazil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is bound on a highly important and
secret mission for our company,&rdquo; Mr. Stannart confided
now. &ldquo;He is going far up the Rio Negro, which
joins the Amazon just below the city of Manaus. The
party <i>supposedly</i> will be looking for sites for rubber
plantations.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Mr. Stannart paused, then said solemnly, &ldquo;Your
father will be looking for gold&mdash;a fabulous gold mine
about which we have secret information. But here in
New York,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we have just discovered
that there has been a leak in that information. We
have learned that certain people would do anything to
stop your father and get to the mine first. Even now,
he may be in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dad didn&rsquo;t say anything about it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he doesn&rsquo;t know about it. He may change
his mind about letting you accompany him after you
give him this letter. It will tell him all he needs to
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff put the letter deep down into his coat pocket.
Mr. Stannart nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful what you say to strangers,&rdquo; he warned
Biff, &ldquo;and above all, guard that letter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was nearly time for the departure of Biff&rsquo;s plane.
Mr. Stannart explained that it would take him to
Belem, the capital city of the Brazilian state of Para,
not far from the mouth of the Amazon. There, Biff
would change to a plane for Manaus, a thousand miles
up the great river.</p>
<p>Mr. Stannart studied the other passengers who were
waiting to board the plane. He said to Biff in parting,
in a low but confident tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have any trouble on this flight. But be
careful after you leave Belem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The long trip south did prove uneventful. During
daylight, the plane was over the Atlantic Ocean, and
darkness had settled when it reached the coast of Brazil.
Biff landed in Belem at dawn, so it wasn&rsquo;t until
he had changed to the plane for Manaus that he gained
his first view of the Brazilian jungle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>He saw it from a seat beside the window as the
plane climbed above Belem; a vast, solid mass of billowing
green that looked ready to swallow the city
that spread below. Then the jungle ended, and the
plane was flying over a huge expanse of brownish
water streaked with waves of white. This was the
Amazon River, stretching as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>A smooth voice purred from beside Biff&rsquo;s shoulder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks more like an ocean than a river, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff turned to meet the gaze of the smiling man
sitting beside him whose eyes looked sharp even
through his dark-green glasses. The large lenses gave
an olive hue to the sleek, oval face that narrowed to a
pointed chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>O Rio Mar</i>,&rdquo; the smiling man continued. &ldquo;That is
what Brazilians call the Amazon. It means &lsquo;The River
Sea&rsquo; in Portuguese. Do you understand the language?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; replied Biff, &ldquo;but I know Spanish better.&rdquo;
He was about to add that he had learned both
from his father. Then, remembering Mr. Stannart&rsquo;s
warning to be careful when he talked to strangers,
Biff stated simply but truthfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been studying Spanish in school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will need to speak Portuguese,&rdquo; the man declared,
&ldquo;if you are stopping off anywhere between
Belem and Manaus.&rdquo; He paused inquiringly. Then,
getting no response, he added, &ldquo;If you go farther up
the Amazon or any of its tributaries, you will need to
know the dialects of Indian tribes as well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>The stranger&rsquo;s easy, persuasive tone almost caused
Biff to remark that he was going on beyond Manaus.
But he caught himself in time and said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have to talk fast, too,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s fellow passenger
continued. &ldquo;Those tribes are often dangerous.
You are sure to find head-hunters among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, Biff asked a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been among the head-hunters, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger&rsquo;s smile widened. &ldquo;My name is Serbot,
Nicholas Serbot. And yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruce Brewster. My friends call me Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas Serbot inclined his head politely. &ldquo;No, I
have never been among the head-hunters, Biff. I come
to Manaus occasionally to do business for some European
concerns that I represent. Mostly in rubber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dad is in Manaus,&rdquo; Biff volunteered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
meeting him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he will take you on a jungle safari. They
organize such trips in Manaus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds great!&rdquo; exclaimed Biff. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mention
it to Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to inquire at the Hotel Amazonas,&rdquo; suggested
Serbot. &ldquo;Meanwhile&rdquo;&mdash;he leaned toward Biff
as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;you may find the scene below quite interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the head of the Para River, the
principal mouth of the Amazon, sixty miles above
Belem. The plane was thrumming over a gigantic
carpet of thickly tufted green, furrowed by a maze
of irregular streams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;The region of the Thousand Islands,&rdquo; Serbot explained.
&ldquo;Those channels that twist through the solid
jungle are called the Narrows. They come from the
main course of the Amazon, and most of them are
deep enough to be navigable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Below, Biff saw an ocean-going freighter working
up through a watery passage. It looked like a toy boat
from this altitude, and occasionally it was swallowed
by the thick foliage that jutted over the channel, only
to emerge from the green arcade.</p>
<p>Soon the boat was far behind, and Biff watched the
narrow channels widen and merge into a limitless,
white-capped sea&mdash;the great Amazon itself. Serbot&rsquo;s
purring voice, and the steady drone of the plane&rsquo;s
motors had a lulling effect. Biff&rsquo;s eyes closed to avoid
the glare of the tropical sun; soon he was asleep. He
dreamed that he was back at Idlewild, with Mr. Stannart&rsquo;s
voice repeating:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard this letter as you would your life! Guard
this letter....&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dream, invisible fingers seemed to be plucking
the precious envelope, drawing it up and out of
Biff&rsquo;s pocket. With a sudden start, Biff awoke and
shot his own hand to his pocket, where it met the
crinkle of paper.</p>
<p>The dream had been realistic in one respect. As he
dozed, Biff must have kept slumping down into his
seat, causing the envelope to work upward every time
he hunched his shoulders. A few inches more and it
would have fallen from his pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Or was that the answer? What if those phantom
fingers had been real instead of mere figments of a
dream!</p>
<p>As he thrust the envelope far down into his inside
pocket and buttoned his coat for safer keeping, Biff
Brewster shot a suspicious glance toward his companion
of the plane trip, the smooth-spoken man who
called himself Nicholas Serbot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />The Clutching Hand</h2>
<p>Biff was wide awake now, the drone of the plane
growing louder in his ears. With it, his suspicions of
Serbot faded. The smiling man was leaning back in his
seat, his own eyes closed as if in sleep. His hands were
folded loosely across his stomach.</p>
<p>For the first time, Biff saw why Serbot wore that
constant smile. The left side of his mouth was curled
to match the right, which was drawn upward by a
scar that began at the corner of his lips and became increasingly
jagged until it ended beside his right eyebrow.</p>
<p>Before, the large rims and green tint of the sun
glasses had helped to hide the scar; but Serbot had removed
them before he went to sleep. Now, as Biff
studied him, Serbot opened his eyes slowly and gave
Biff a sleepy glance. Realizing that Biff had observed
the scar, Serbot raised his right hand and traced it
lightly with his forefinger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;A decoration I received during World War Two,&rdquo;
he commented, &ldquo;while I was working with the French
Underground. A Nazi spy tried to give me this&mdash;&rdquo;
Graphically, Serbot swept his hand across his throat&mdash;&ldquo;but
I managed to save my neck. I received this instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Serbot clenched his left fist as though it contained
a weapon. He grabbed his left wrist with his right
hand and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anyone attacks you with a knife or gun, don&rsquo;t
try to stop him that way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t work
fast enough, as I found out. Hit his wrist like this&rdquo;&mdash;Serbot
opened his right hand, bent it backward,
and drove it against his left wrist&mdash;&ldquo;with the heel of
your hand, upward and outward. Try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff practiced the action a few times and apparently
won Serbot&rsquo;s approval, for the smiling man added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That not only will stop him, it will jar the weapon
from his grasp, enabling you to snatch it all in the
same move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Serbot demonstrated that, too. Then, noting that
some of the other passengers were beginning to look
their way, Serbot changed the subject abruptly. Leaning
toward Biff, he began pointing out more sights
from the window, as the plane followed the north
bank of the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>There, the jungle had opened into widespread grazing
lands, studded by a range of low, flat-topped
mountains. Perched on one summit was a little town
that Serbot said was called Monte Alegre. Then they
were far out over the river again, and the Amazon
once more resembled a choppy, yellow sea, until the
order came to &ldquo;Fasten safety belts!&rdquo; The plane was
coming to a landing at Santar&eacute;m on the south bank.</p>
<p>Serbot pointed out to Biff the wide Tapaj&oacute;z River
which disgorged a huge flood into the turbulent Amazon,
splotching the yellow tide with long streaks of
green that looked like wash from the jungle and shone
with emerald brilliance in the noonday sun.</p>
<p>The plane roared off again, and at Obidos, eighty
miles farther upstream, the Amazon narrowed to a
single deep channel only a mile and a quarter wide
with the walls of solid forests fringing both bluffs.
Later, the river widened again, and Serbot indicated
small settlements built on high stilts in clearings back
from the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those show you how high the river rises,&rdquo; Serbot
told Biff. &ldquo;Often it overflows its banks for many miles
on both sides. Some of the native villages are so far off
in the jungle that they can only be reached when the
Amazon is in flood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between pointing out these interesting scenes, Serbot
talked occasionally of his war experiences, and
Biff, wide awake and alert ever since his morning nap,
was enjoying the trip more and more. He realized
that he was gaining a slight preview of the Brazilian
jungle that might prove helpful when he and his
father set out on the safari that was actually to be a
gold hunt. But he was careful to avoid answering any
direct questions that Serbot put to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>It was late afternoon when Serbot indicated a great,
dark swirl of water that merged with the muddy
Amazon, marking the mouth of another huge tributary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The black water of the Rio Negro,&rdquo; defined Serbot.
&ldquo;From here it is only ten miles up to Manaus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon, the plane landed at the Manaus airport, and a
few minutes later, Biff was being welcomed by his
father, a tall, rugged man with dark hair and tanned,
square-jawed face, an older counterpart of Biff himself,
except for the boy&rsquo;s blond hair. But when Biff
looked around for Mr. Serbot, hoping to introduce
him to Mr. Brewster, he found to his surprise that his
companion of the plane trip had already gone.</p>
<p>Biff and his dad talked about the family and everything
at home while they were picking up Biff&rsquo;s luggage.
Mr. Brewster then led the way to a jeep that he
had parked outside the airport. Before they started
their drive into the city, Biff drew the sealed envelope
from his pocket and handed it to his father with the
comment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, this is from Mr. Stannart. He told me to
guard it carefully, that it is very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster tore open the envelope, and Biff
watched his expression change as he read the letter.
His lips set tightly above his firm jaw, Mr. Brewster
thrust the letter into his own pocket; then he started
the jeep. Keeping a sharp eye along the rough road,
he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Stannart mention what was in the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a way, he did,&rdquo; rejoined Biff. &ldquo;He said we were
supposed to be going with a rubber-hunting expedition,
but that actually we would be looking for
gold&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mention that to anyone, did you?&rdquo; interrupted
Mr. Brewster anxiously. &ldquo;I mean, while
you were on the plane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only talked to a man named Mr. Serbot,&rdquo; returned
Biff, &ldquo;and I even played dumb when he suggested
that you take me on a safari. He said we could
make arrangements at the Hotel Amazonas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff saw his father&rsquo;s taut expression change to one
of relief. Mr. Brewster spurted the jeep over a watery
stretch of road with the comment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These jeeps have to be real puddle jumpers. You
never know how deep some of the mud holes are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The road improved as they swung into the city. It
was then that Mr. Brewster asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Stannart tell you that there might be serious
danger, now that other persons are after the
mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he said you must be warned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is why he let you come,&rdquo; mused Mr.
Brewster. &ldquo;Frankly, I feel he made a mistake, and I
should send you straight home. However, if we keep
far enough ahead of trouble, it may not catch up with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster ended with a reassuring smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the story from the start,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;During World War Two, two prospectors, Lew
Kirby and Joe Nara, gave up hunting gold and diamonds
down in the state of Minas Geraes and came up
the Amazon to help gather rubber. They put their
profits into food and supplies and kept going north to
look for a fabled land of gold&mdash;a land called El Dorado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;El Dorado! We learned about him in American
History!&rdquo; Biff exclaimed. &ldquo;It sounded crazier than
science fiction. Wasn&rsquo;t El Dorado supposed to be a
king who came out of a lake with his body all covered
with gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Originally, yes,&rdquo; returned Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;Then
the story became a legend of a golden city and finally
a golden land. The Spaniards looked for it, and so did
Sir Walter Raleigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But nobody ever found it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody except Lew Kirby and Joe Nara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure that his father was joking, Biff expected a
chuckle to follow. But Mr. Brewster was very serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They uncovered a fabulous Inca mine,&rdquo; resumed
Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;It was too far and too difficult to
bring the gold down the Amazon. So they worked
their way to the Orinoco River, which brought them
out through Venezuela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kirby sent Nara back to the mine and then returned
to Minas Geraes, hoping to find someone to
help finance the claim. But people either didn&rsquo;t believe
his story, or they were the sort he wouldn&rsquo;t trust.
But he trusted me and I believed him&mdash;when he gave
me these.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Mr. Brewster brought out of his pocket some small
samples of ore that fairly glistened with gold. Biff had
learned enough regarding mining and minerals from
his dad to recognize the value of these specimens. In
an awed tone Biff asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there much of this in the mine, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole mountain full,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brewster,
&ldquo;from what Lew Kirby told me&mdash;before he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jeep was rolling smoothly now along a boulevard
lined with fig trees, all neatly trimmed to a
mushroom shape. But the story of the fabled gold
mine interested Biff more than the sights of Manaus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lew gave me a map,&rdquo; continued Mr. Brewster,
&ldquo;showing the route that he followed to reach the
headwaters of the Orinoco, though it does not give
the exact location of the mine. To learn that, we must
find Joe Nara. I hope that no one else finds him
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the persons mentioned in Mr. Stannart&rsquo;s letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Biff. Despite Mr. Stannart&rsquo;s constant
urging, the directors of the Ajax Corporation have
been painfully slow in providing funds for our trip.
Meanwhile, Mr. Stannart says in his letter, certain
foreign interests have learned of the mine and have
moved into the picture. They may be the sort who
will stop at nothing to get that mine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Before Biff could ask more questions, the jeep
pulled up beside a modest, low-built structure that
bore the sign: HOTEL JACARES. Looking about,
Biff was surprised to see that it was growing dark and
that the street lamps were already aglow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night falls swiftly here in the tropics,&rdquo; explained
Mr. Brewster, as they went through the hotel lobby
and up the stairs to the second floor. &ldquo;That is why I
lost no time coming from the airport. The driving is
difficult after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster unlocked the door of his room,
turned on the light, then halted in amazement. The
place was strewn with clothes from his suitcases.
Sheets had been ripped from beds and mattresses cut
open. Papers were scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>In a corner was a framed mirror hanging above a
washstand. Mr. Brewster hurried over, took down
the mirror, and laid it on a table beside a closet door.
He pried away the backing of the mirror and brought
out a sheet of paper that had been hidden there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what they were after!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The
one thing they couldn&rsquo;t find! Kirby&rsquo;s map!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mr. Brewster spoke, the closet door was opening
slowly, but it was behind his shoulder and
he didn&rsquo;t see it. From the crack slid a long, bare human
arm, and a hand reached for the prize that Mr.
Brewster flourished. Frantically, Biff shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad! Look out!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />The Hidden Boathouse</h2>
<p>Mr. Brewster swung about at Biff&rsquo;s warning, an
instant too late. The hand had already clutched the
map and was snatching it from his grasp. The map
tore apart, leaving only a corner in Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>Quickly, Biff&rsquo;s father dove for the closet door, intending
to slam it and trap the occupant, map and all.
But the man in the closet moved swiftly, too. He
flung the door wide, and its edge swept past Mr.
Brewster&rsquo;s fingers as the man dived under his arm.
Biff, crouched low, was about to stop the intruder
with a football tackle when Mr. Brewster overtook
the fugitive, applied a powerful arm-hold, and
brought him full about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Biff saw that the struggling man&rsquo;s face was masked
behind a large, knotted bandanna handkerchief, and
that his rough, baggy clothes disguised his height and
weight. As he twisted in Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s grasp, the
man managed to thrust his hand into the folds of his
jacket and whip out a revolver. Coming about, he
aimed point-blank at Mr. Brewster.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s father dropped away a split second before
the revolver barked, its muzzle tonguing flame inches
above his head. Then, before the masked man could
fire again, Mr. Brewster wheeled about, grabbed a
small table with both hands, and flung it bodily at
his masked foe.</p>
<p>The man darted out of the way, only to find Biff
blocking his escape. Biff heard a snarl from behind
the bandanna, and saw the glint of the gun barrel as
the man swung the weapon with a savage, downward
stroke. Instinctively, Biff shot his own hand upward,
using the trick that Serbot had shown him on the
plane that very day.</p>
<p>The heel of Biff&rsquo;s hand caught the man&rsquo;s wrist,
driving it outward. The impact jolted the gun from
his hand, but the weapon scaled toward the side of the
room and clattered near the bottom of the wall, where
Mr. Brewster sprang across and scooped it from the
floor, practically on the rebound.</p>
<p>The masked man hadn&rsquo;t tried to retrieve the gun.
Instead, he dashed through the doorway to the hall,
still clutching the stolen map. Biff raced after him,
with Mr. Brewster close behind. They might have
overtaken the fugitive if he had gone down the stairway
to the lobby, but instead he chose a shorter route
to a large open window at the other end of the hall.
There, he leaped a low railing, carrying a loose screen
with him. When Biff reached the window and looked
down into the dark, the man had vanished in the thick
mesh of tropical foliage that had broken his fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;No use trying to go after him,&rdquo; decided Mr.
Brewster ruefully. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even know the direction
he has taken. The hotel clerk will have heard the shot.
We&rsquo;ll let him report the incident to the police. They&rsquo;ll
figure it was just a sneak thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the map?&rdquo; Biff inquired anxiously.
&ldquo;How will you find the route to the Orinoco without
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still have the corner that shows the mine itself,&rdquo;
declared Mr. Brewster, holding it for Biff to see. &ldquo;And
Joe Nara would have to guide us there anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s father frowned. &ldquo;We <i>may</i> have trouble getting
through to the Orinoco, if someone tries to block
our way. But from there on, it should be smooth sailing.
Mr. Stannart says in his letter that he will bring
his yacht to meet us on our way back, and will sign
the agreement with Nara, then and there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to their room, Biff and his father met the
manager of the hotel hastening up the stairs. Mr.
Brewster told him briefly that they had surprised a
sneak thief in their room, and handed over the intruder&rsquo;s
revolver. With profuse apologies, the manager departed
after Mr. Brewster refused his offer to have the
room put in order.</p>
<p>When they were alone, Biff&rsquo;s father said, &ldquo;It was
neat, the way you disarmed that fellow. Where did
you learn that trick?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;From Mr. Serbot,&rdquo; replied Biff, &ldquo;the man I met on
the plane coming from Belem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were repacking Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s bags and
clearing up the room, Biff told his father about the
things they had discussed on the plane. Mr. Brewster
listened intently, then asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell Serbot that I was stopping at this
hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positively not,&rdquo; returned Biff. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t possibly
have learned it&mdash;unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless he saw the envelope,&rdquo; exclaimed Biff in a
hollow tone. &ldquo;It nearly worked out of my pocket
while I was asleep. Mr. Serbot <i>might</i> have drawn it
out that far. When I looked at him, though, he was
asleep, with his hands folded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Playing innocent, perhaps. Did he seem to make a
habit of folding his hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that was the only time I saw them folded.
Dad&rdquo;&mdash;Biff&rsquo;s tone became worried&mdash;&ldquo;do you think
Mr. Serbot read the address on the envelope and
phoned someone from the airport, and told them to
come up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised,&rdquo; his father asserted grimly.
&ldquo;The envelope has the return address of the Ajax
Mining Corporation, and that would identify us to
anyone who is trying to beat us to the El Dorado
mine. But let&rsquo;s not jump to conclusions just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster had finished packing his bags. He
picked them up and nodded for Biff to bring his, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send these out to the airport,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster
declared. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a plane going up the Rio Negro
at dawn, and our luggage can go on it. We may take
that plane, or perhaps a later one. We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made arrangements with the hotel porter to
handle the baggage. After that, Mr. Brewster decided
that they should go out for dinner so Biff could see the
city. Once on the lighted streets of Manaus, Biff realized
how futile it would be to look for the baggily
clad man who had stolen the map. Dozens of workmen
who passed them were dressed in similar attire,
even to a bandanna worn as a neckerchief.</p>
<p>The gay life of the tropical city impressed Biff.
There were brilliantly lighted downtown caf&eacute;s, and
Mr. Brewster chose one where they were served half
a dozen courses of tasty, highly seasoned food, finishing
with ice cream that Biff thought was the best
he had ever eaten. He had just swallowed the last
spoonful when he suddenly exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Dad! Those two men sitting at that table
in the corner! One of them is Mr. Serbot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster had no difficulty in picking out Serbot
from Biff&rsquo;s earlier description, though the scar on
the smiling man&rsquo;s cheek was scarcely visible in the
soft light of the caf&eacute;. Serbot&rsquo;s companion was shorter
and chunkier, with a broad face, quick, narrow eyes,
and straight lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Introduce me on the way out,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster told
Biff. &ldquo;I would like to size up that pair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>A few minutes later, Biff&rsquo;s father was shaking hands
with Serbot, who immediately introduced his stocky
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Senhor Armandeo,&rdquo; stated Serbot. &ldquo;Pepito
Armandeo, known as Grande Pepito, or Big Pepito,
as you would call him in English. He is a famous
wrestler.&rdquo; Smoothly, Serbot changed the subject.
&ldquo;You have a very intelligent son, Senhor Brewster. I
enjoyed my trip with him. You are interested in rubber,
Senhor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else,&rdquo; asked Mr. Brewster, &ldquo;would bring me
to Manaus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Serbot&rsquo;s response was a noticeable increase of his
perpetual smile. He bowed as he made the parting
comment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we have mutual interests, Senhor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the caf&eacute;, Mr. Brewster spoke reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Serbot and I do have mutual interests,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;In something bigger than rubber. Something
like gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They climbed into the jeep, and Mr. Brewster
drove past the Amazonas Theater, the magnificent
opera house that had been built when Manaus was a
boom town in the jungle. Mr. Brewster mentioned
that to Biff as they went by; but Biff realized that his
father was thinking of something else. Finally, he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not surprised that you suspected Serbot. He
strikes me as being very shrewd. I am doubtful of his
friend, Big Pepito, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then maybe Serbot sent Pepito to steal the map!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions too quickly, Biff.&rdquo; Mr.
Brewster smiled as he spoke. &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t understand
how Serbot could have learned so much. Nobody
knew my plans except Mr. Stannart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the directors of the Ajax Company,
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once they agreed, they gave Stannart full say. Our
dealings were confidential. Stannart sent me funds to
buy safari equipment which I shipped here to Manaus
ahead of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Serbot talked about safaris on the plane
trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you told me, Biff.&rdquo; Mr. Brewster frowned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think that somebody found out
about our plans here in Manaus. Pepito, for instance,
could have learned of the safari shipments and sent
word to Serbot. But Hal Whitman should have suspected
something and informed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hal Whitman? Who is he, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who received the shipments here. He assembled
them secretly in a boathouse a few miles up
the river. Later, he loaded all the supplies and took
them far up the river to an old landing above Santa
Isabel. He is waiting there for us to join him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster halted the car at an intersection and
pondered for a few moments. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody could have snooped around that boathouse
after Whitman left. They might have learned
where the shipments came from and perhaps gained
some link between Whitman and myself. If we go out
there, we might pick up some clue ourselves. It&rsquo;s
worth a try.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Mr. Brewster headed for the outskirts of the city.
The road became rougher, and he was handling the
jeep in its best puddle-jumping style as he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe some spies are still around the boathouse,
trying to learn what else they can. In that case, we
can surprise them. If the boathouse is empty, we can
wait inside it and see if anyone shows up later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the jeep swung beneath an arch of trees, Biff
was startled by what looked like human figures jumping
from bough to bough in the glow of the moonlight.
Mr. Brewster laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just monkeys. Don&rsquo;t let them worry you. There
is the boathouse. You can see our headlights reflected
in its windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster cut off the headlights as he spoke,
but oddly, the reflection persisted for a few moments
more. Biff thought it was his imagination, but his father
decided otherwise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is moving around inside with a flashlight,&rdquo;
he whispered. &ldquo;The boathouse is on pontoons
to allow for the rise and fall of the river. If we reach
the gangplank first, we can trap them before they
come ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently Biff and his father slipped out of the jeep
and crept forward beneath overhanging boughs that
Biff could hear creak above him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>This time, he was thinking about people in the boathouse,
not monkeys in the trees. He was watching for
a flashlight instead of looking up into the moonlight.
That proved to be a bad mistake.</p>
<p>Two living human figures dropped from the
branches like massive rubber balls, one taking Biff as
a target, the other landing squarely on Mr. Brewster.
In their hands, these silent, shadowy attackers carried
thin ropes that they looped around the necks of their
victims as they flattened them.</p>
<p>Biff heard his father give a short, gurgling cry.
Then Biff was gasping as the cord tightened around
his own neck. Next, his captor clapped a cloth to his
face, and Biff was stifled by a strong, pungent odor
that completely overpowered him. His head seemed
to burst with stabs of flashing light that turned to utter
blackness as his senses left him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>

<br />The Safari Starts</h2>
<p><i>Thrumm&mdash;thrumm&mdash;thrumm&mdash;thrumm&mdash;</i></p>
<p>As Biff awakened, the steady sound made him think
that he was back on the plane above the Amazon. He
opened his eyes expecting to see the yellow sea far
below.</p>
<p>Instead, he saw black water streaming past the side
of a boat, churning white as it scudded back into the
distance. When he turned his head, he saw his father
beside him.</p>
<p>They were propped against some boxes near the
front of a long cabin cruiser, which had a permanent
top stretched like a canopy over its large, open cockpit,
making it ideal for tropical travel. But there was
nothing ideal about Biff&rsquo;s present plight.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s hands were bound in back of him by a rough
cord that chafed his wrists. His ankles, too, were
tightly tied. At a glance, Biff saw that his father was
in a similar situation. The thin, tough rope around Mr.
Brewster&rsquo;s ankles looked like a tropical vine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Biff tried to speak, but he found his lips too dry, his
throat too parched. He caught a warning headshake
from his father, and following the direction of Mr.
Brewster&rsquo;s gaze, Biff saw two chunky men, clad in
baggy, sleeveless shirts and old khaki trousers cut off
at the knees.</p>
<p>The pair were standing guard like patient watchdogs,
looking for any move from the captives. They
had black, straight hair and coppery skin; those features,
plus their stony, immobile expressions marked
them as Indians from the headwaters of the river,
which, from its blackish color, could only be the Rio
Negro.</p>
<p>One Indian spoke in a guttural dialect, and a shrill
voice responded from up ahead:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they&rsquo;re awake now? Good! Igo, you take the
wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One Indian moved forward. Moments later, a
scrawny man with a crafty, wizened face beneath a
shock of whitish hair, stepped into sight. To the other
Indian, he piped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ubi, you stay here. You help me watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, tilting his head in birdlike fashion, the white-haired
man studied the prisoners and demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you two doing around that boathouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster kept his lips tightly closed, his eyes
staring straight back toward the frothy wake from the
cruiser&rsquo;s propeller. Biff, too, ignored the question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d talk if I gave you a drink of water,&rdquo;
the scrawny man suggested, &ldquo;and maybe I ought to toss
you in that big drink out there&rdquo;&mdash;he gestured toward
the river&mdash;&ldquo;and let you try to swim ashore. You
wouldn&rsquo;t get far, tied like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stolid silence of the Brewsters annoyed the
white-haired man. His voice rose to a still higher
pitch:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it, every word of it! I&rsquo;ll find a way to
make you talk, as sure as my name is Joe Nara!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff almost gulped the name, &ldquo;Joe Nara!&rdquo; before
he caught himself. Then he heard his father speak
calmly in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are really Joe Nara,&rdquo; stated Mr. Brewster,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all you want to know. Only I don&rsquo;t believe
that you are Joe Nara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oddly, the wizened man&rsquo;s anger faded. His own
tone became even as he asked, &ldquo;And why wouldn&rsquo;t I
be Joe Nara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Nara is a husky chap,&rdquo; returned Mr. Brewster,
&ldquo;with dark hair, a bit gray, but not white. He&rsquo;s tough,
but he doesn&rsquo;t get angry and excited. He has too good
a sense of humor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff saw a twinkle in the wizened man&rsquo;s eyes. The
scrawny face relaxed in a genuine smile. In a soft,
faraway tone, he asked, &ldquo;And who told you all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Nara&rsquo;s partner, Lew Kirby, before he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Lew is dead. I was afraid of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, the wizened man&rsquo;s expression became
very sorrowful. He gestured to Ubi, and the Indian
cut the crude ropes that bound the prisoners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> Joe Nara,&rdquo; the white-haired man said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
grown a lot older in the years since I saw Lew Kirby
last. Kind of lost my sense of humor, too, living upriver
with nobody but Indians to talk to. What&rsquo;s your
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Brewster. And this is my son Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster extended his own hand, palm up. Old
Joe Nara slapped his own hand palm downward,
meeting Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s with a solid whack, followed
by a tight grip to which Mr. Brewster responded
firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how Lew and I always shook hands,&rdquo; declared
Nara. &ldquo;I guess you and Lew were friends all
right, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have shown you that grip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ubi was bringing gourds of water. Nara waited
until Biff and his father had slaked their thirst. Then,
with a chuckle, the white-haired man remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Lew must have told you about the time he
and I went to Lake Titicaca down in Peru to look for
Inca gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Kirby never told me that,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Brewster, &ldquo;because you never went there. He said
you planned the trip but gave it up. You came up this
way instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where would we have found gold near the
headwaters of the Rio Negro?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you in two words: El Dorado.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>That convinced Joe Nara. He opened a door beneath
the short forward deck and revealed a compact
kitchen galley. He heated up a pot of <i>feijoada</i>, a Brazilian
dish of black beans cooked with dried meat.
With it he served bowls of <i>mandioca</i>, a mush made
from the pulp of the <i>cassava</i>.</p>
<p>Simple though the fare was, it tasted so good that
Biff eagerly accepted the second helping that Nara
offered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was really hungry,&rdquo; said Biff. &ldquo;I feel as though
I had been asleep for hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were,&rdquo; returned Nara. &ldquo;That stuff you inhaled
is a secret Indian brew that acts like chloroform.
Gives you an appetite, though, when you do wake
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just why,&rdquo; asked Mr. Brewster dryly, &ldquo;did
you happen to try the stuff out on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why,&rdquo; asserted Nara. &ldquo;Every now and
then, I come down from the mine with Igo and Ubi
to buy supplies. Whatever I buy, I pay for with
these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From his pocket, Nara brought some small nuggets
of pure gold which clinked heavily when he trickled
them from one hand to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People have been trying to trail me back up to the
mine,&rdquo; continued Nara, &ldquo;so I bought this boat, the
<i>Xanadu</i>, from a rubber outfit that had gone broke. I
decided to come downriver to see who was spying on
me. Before I even got to Santa Isabel, I saw a crew
unloading supplies at an old abandoned camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whitman&rsquo;s crew!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;I sent
them up the Rio Negro to wait for me, so I could
start on a safari to find your mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Nara gave an understanding chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had Igo and Ubi talk to the natives,&rdquo; Nara said.
&ldquo;They learned that the expedition had started from a
boathouse outside of Manaus. So I came all the way
down the river to look into it. We were watching
the boathouse when you came along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you thought we were enemies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly enemies,&rdquo; corrected Nara. &ldquo;Just suspicious
characters. After Igo and Ubi grabbed you, I
decided to bring you along. Now that you&rsquo;ve explained
yourselves, I&rsquo;ll turn around and take you back
down to Manaus if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;ve started upriver,&rdquo; decided Mr.
Brewster, &ldquo;there is no need to go back. We sent our
luggage on to Santa Isabel by air, and we intended to
take a plane ourselves. But now we may as well keep
on with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that day, the <i>Xanadu</i> sped swiftly up the Rio
Negro. Biff took his turn at the wheel and was pleased
by the way the cruiser handled. At intervals, the river
became so thick with islands that it reminded Biff of
the famous Narrows that he had seen from the air
above the lower Amazon. But here on the Rio Negro,
the channels were shallow as well as twisty. Still,
Biff found no difficulty in guiding the sleek craft
through the maze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Xanadu</i> was built to order for this river,&rdquo;
Nara told Biff. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I bought her. Be careful,
though, when we reach that island dead ahead. The
channel appears to split there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p001.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="682" />
<p class="caption"><i>The</i> Xanadu <i>thrummed upriver</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>As Nara spoke, the palm-fringed island vanished.
The whole sky had opened in one tremendous downpour.
Biff couldn&rsquo;t believe that it was only rain. He
thought for the moment that the <i>Xanadu</i> had come
beneath a tremendous waterfall. Adding to the illusion
was the sudden rise of steam from the heated
jungle that flanked the channel. Instantly, the speeding
cruiser was shrouded in a mist that swelled above
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swing her about!&rdquo; shrilled Nara. &ldquo;Our only
chance is to turn downstream before the flood hits
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster stepped up and took the wheel. Instead
of taking Nara&rsquo;s advice, he sped the boat straight
upstream, picking his course in an amazing fashion.
Somehow, he must have gauged the exact position of
the threatening island, for he veered past it. New
channels seemed to open with each swerve of the
cruiser&rsquo;s bow.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s father had seen Navy service in the South
Pacific and was familiar with jungle waterways as
well as tropical storms. As a Lieutenant, Junior Grade,
he had been trained specially for jungle fighting and
had won medals for bravery, finally leaving the service
as a Lieutenant Commander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to buck the current,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster declared,
&ldquo;than to let it carry us into something we
can&rsquo;t avoid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Igo and Ubi were releasing curtains from beneath
the permanent top, giving the cruiser&rsquo;s interior the
effect of a long, narrow tent, completely sheltered
from the terrific downpour, which like many tropical
rains, was coming straight downward.</p>
<p>Some of the narrow channels were flooding rapidly,
and there, big logs and branches occasionally met the
cruiser&rsquo;s rounded prow, only to glance aside as Mr.
Brewster deftly turned the wheel. They reached a
wider channel where a headland bulked suddenly in
midstream; but it proved to be a small floating island,
composed of small palm trees sprouting from a mass
of soil and undergrowth that had come loose from
an overhanging bank.</p>
<p>Biff could hear the chatter of monkeys and the
screech of birds as the passing branches scraped the
hanging canvas on the cruiser&rsquo;s side. Then the tiny islet
and its excited living freight had drifted far downstream.
Still Mr. Brewster kept steadily to his course,
staring upstream through the cruiser&rsquo;s rainswept windshield.</p>
<p>Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the rain ended,
revealing a new maze of channels that could be found
only by looking for gaps among the tree branches,
so high had the water risen in this sunken area. Cutting
the speed, Mr. Brewster navigated the openings
gingerly. That brought a chuckle from Joe Nara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of lucky, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was rather lucky,&rdquo; acknowledged Mr.
Brewster. &ldquo;Like you and Lew Kirby, when you stumbled
onto that mine of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were more than lucky,&rdquo; retorted Nara. &ldquo;We
were smart. Didn&rsquo;t Lew tell you how we doped it
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said you ran into a tribe of Indians who were
guarding a mountain that they claimed was sacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Wai Wai Indians. Igo and Ubi are
members of the tribe.&rdquo; Nara gestured toward the
stolid pair who now were rolling up the canvas curtains.
&ldquo;What else did Lew say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said you convinced the Indians that you were
a powerful witch doctor, so they led you to the lost
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the tricks I showed them,&rdquo; chuckled Nara,
&ldquo;they thought I was El Dorado the Original, and that
the mine belonged to me and Lew. You know the
story of the man who turned all golden? Well, I
proved it could be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff was hoping that Nara would give more details
on that subject, when suddenly, the white-haired man
demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Lew give you a map to locate the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;He gave me
one showing a route from the mine to some waterways
which he said led to the Orinoco River. That
was all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was enough. It proved there was a short way
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I still have to go over the actual route to
make sure that gold ore could be transported by it,
down the Orinoco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have the map with you now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From deep in his pocket, Mr. Brewster produced
the torn corner from Kirby&rsquo;s map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A prowler stole the rest from my hotel room,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;I managed to hold on to the part that
shows the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Nara stroked his chin in worried fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If somebody showed me the rest of the map,&rdquo; he
commented, &ldquo;I might have to believe them if they
said they knew Lew Kirby, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; returned Mr. Brewster calmly,
&ldquo;and I would be glad if such a person should appear.
It would be a case of a thief trapping himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Nara nodded as though he agreed; but he immediately
dropped the subject of the map and the
mine as well.</p>
<p>During the next few days, the <i>Xanadu</i> thrummed
upriver, keeping to broad channels instead of short-cuts
between islands. This simplified the handling of
the cruiser during brief but heavy rainstorms. Biff
noted that after each rain the air soon became as humid
as before. It was hot at night as well as in the
daytime, and while one member of the group piloted
the cruiser under the bright tropical moon, the others
slept in the ample cockpit; never in the tiny forward
cabin.</p>
<p>One evening when Nara was at the wheel, Biff
and his father were seated near the stern, far enough
away for Biff to ask:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Joe Nara doubts your story, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;About the map being stolen?&rdquo; returned Mr. Brewster.
&ldquo;He might be wondering about it. After all, I
could have torn the corner from a map that belonged
to someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you gave him Kirby&rsquo;s hand grip and when you
mentioned &lsquo;El Dorado&rsquo; it was like a password.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have learned those from some other person.
Nara has to be cautious, with a gold mine at stake.
I think he trusts me but wants to sound me out. Watch
him, and you&rsquo;ll see he is suspicious of everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff noted that as the trip continued, Nara insisted
upon giving other river craft a wide berth. When occasional
airplanes flew high above, Nara always
leaned out from beneath the canopy to study them
suspiciously, but the planes apparently took no notice
of the boat below.</p>
<p>After the cruiser had passed Santa Isabel, Biff was
taking his turn at the wheel when Nara approached
and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty soon we&rsquo;ll drop you and your dad at the
old rubber camp where your friend Whitman is waiting
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to join us on the safari?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not there,&rdquo; returned Nara. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking the
<i>Xanadu</i> on to Sao Gabriel, to see if we can buck the
rapids and reach the upper river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster had been close enough to hear Nara&rsquo;s
comment. Now, he put the query:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where will we meet you, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;At Piedra Del Cucuy,&rdquo; Nara replied. &ldquo;You can see
it for miles, a big rock rising from the forest, where
Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia all meet up. By the
time you arrive there, we will know if it is safe to go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t it be safe?&rdquo; asked Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the Macus, the head-hunters who raid
the river settlements.&rdquo; Nara turned to his two Indians
and said: &ldquo;Tell them about the Macus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macu very bad,&rdquo; stated Igo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macu kill for head,&rdquo; added Ubi.</p>
<p>At last the <i>Xanadu</i> reached an old, dilapidated landing,
where half a dozen men stood beside some huts
on the high bank. Mr. Brewster indicated one man
who was wearing khaki shorts, white shirt, and pith
helmet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Whitman,&rdquo; said Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too
far away to hail him.&rdquo; He brought out a leather case
containing a flat metal mirror and handed it to Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whitman understands Morse,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster said.
&ldquo;Signal him to send out a boat for us, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff turned the mirror toward the sun, then slanted
it in Whitman&rsquo;s direction. Covering the mirror with
his hand, he flashed the message in dots and dashes:
S-E-N-D B-O-A-T.</p>
<p>Whitman pointed to a canoe on the shore. Biff
watched two figures hurry down and clamber into
the craft, a small figure at the bow, a big one in the
stern. They paddled out to the waiting cruiser and
swung alongside. The man in the stern, a husky, barrel-chested
native, furnished a broad, friendly smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me Jacome,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>The bow paddler was an Indian boy about Biff&rsquo;s
age and size. He was wearing faded blue denim trousers,
ragged at the knees, and a shirt that matched it in
color and tattered sleeves. He reached up to grab the
cruiser&rsquo;s side, adding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Kamuka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff extended his own hand and responded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
Biff.&rdquo; In that unexpected handshake, the two boys established
an immediate friendship. They grinned at
each other as Biff helped Kamuka swing the canoe
about so that Jacome could hold the stern alongside.</p>
<p>As soon as Biff and his father stepped into the canoe
the <i>Xanadu</i> sped off like a startled creature. Joe Nara
at the wheel, waved good-by, while Igo and Ubi
simply stared back like a pair of reversed figureheads.
Jacome and Kamuka did fast work with their paddles
to prevent the canoe from tipping in the cruiser&rsquo;s
swell. Then they headed toward the dock.</p>
<p>Kamuka looked over his shoulder and said to Biff,
&ldquo;I like the way you send message. You show me
how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the short paddle, Mr. Brewster talked to
Jacome in Portuguese and Biff, listening closely, understood
most of what was said. Mr. Brewster asked
about the luggage and was told that it had arrived
by air. Also, he wanted to know if the safari was
ready to start. Jacome told him yes, that they had
been waiting for him to arrive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>When they reached the shore, Hal Whitman was
still up by the huts engaged with the natives in an excited
conversation. Mr. Brewster started in that direction,
and Biff was about to follow when a hand
plucked his sleeve. It was Kamuka, with the request:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spell message now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Biff. He produced the mirror,
caught the sun&rsquo;s glint, and focused it on the wall of a
hut perhaps a hundred feet away. &ldquo;Now, watch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff halted abruptly. A burly native, wearing baggy
white shirt and trousers, with a red bandanna tied
about his head, had joined the argument and was pushing
Mr. Whitman back into the hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Urubu!&rdquo; exclaimed Kamuka. &ldquo;He make trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitman came from the hut with a shotgun and
gestured for the native, Urubu, to be on his way. Instead,
Urubu grabbed for the gun and snatched it
from Whitman&rsquo;s grasp, tripping him at the same time.
Mr. Brewster was starting forward on the run, but he
was too far away to help Whitman.</p>
<p>Urubu raised the gun butt to drive it down on
Whitman&rsquo;s head. Biff could see the savage look on
Urubu&rsquo;s face. Kamuka gripped Biff&rsquo;s arm. The native
boy&rsquo;s voice was breathless:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody must help Mr. Whitman! Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />The Spotted Terror</h2>
<p>That jog from Kamuka&rsquo;s hand gave Biff a sudden
idea. Biff was holding the mirror so it threw a big
spot of sunlight on the hut wall. The spot wavered
when Kamuka jogged Biff&rsquo;s arm, and Urubu was only
a dozen feet from the corner of the hut.</p>
<p>Biff changed the mirror&rsquo;s angle just a slight degree,
spotting the light square in Urubu&rsquo;s eyes. That reflected
glint of the sun was enough. Urubu dropped
back, flinging his arm upward to shield his vision. Mr.
Whitman came to his feet and grappled for the shotgun.
A few seconds later, Mr. Brewster had pitched
into the struggle.</p>
<p>They disarmed Urubu, who stood by glaring sullenly.
Biff and Kamuka approached the group, and
Jacome, who had pulled the canoe on shore, came up
behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what the name Urubu means, Biff?&rdquo;
Kamuka asked.</p>
<p>Biff shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;It means vulture,&rdquo; the Indian boy said.</p>
<p>A chuckle came from Jacome. &ldquo;A good name for
Urubu. He is like one vulture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At close range, Urubu looked the part. He had a
profile like a buzzard&rsquo;s. He stood by, a sullen look on
his face, as Mr. Whitman told Mr. Brewster:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I turned down Urubu as a guide because he lied
to me. He said he had guided safaris for the past five
years, when part of that time he was in jail. Then he
told our porters that I lied to them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; put in Urubu. &ldquo;You said that Senhor
Brewster would arrive three days ago. Instead he has
arrived only now&mdash;as you can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Urubu repeated those remarks to the native bearers
in a mixture of Portuguese and Indian dialect. He was
dumfounded when Mr. Brewster spoke to them in
the same manner. Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s words brought a
murmur of approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want to be paid for the days they waited,&rdquo;
Mr. Brewster told Mr. Whitman. &ldquo;I said we would
pay them, and they are satisfied. Do you need Urubu
as a guide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we can send him away again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was unnecessary. When Mr. Brewster turned
to speak to Urubu, the troublemaker was gone. He
had made a quick departure by the nearest jungle
path. Mr. Whitman promptly called for Luiz, the new
guide, to step forward, and a small, bowing native
came from the group of bearers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Since it was not yet noon, Mr. Brewster ordered
Luiz to get everything ready for an immediate start.
Soon the native bearers, more than a dozen in number,
were hoisting their packs and other equipment.
Meanwhile, Biff was present at a last-minute conference
between his father and Hal Whitman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow our original plan,&rdquo; stated Mr. Brewster.
&ldquo;If we strike off to the northwest and follow
the regular trails, we will appear to be looking for
<i>balata</i> like any other rubber-hunting expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff knew that the term <i>balata</i> referred both to the
rubber tree and its juice. He watched Hal Whitman
mop perspiration from his forehead. Whitman&rsquo;s
worry seemed to vanish with that process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be following the long side of a triangle,&rdquo;
Biff&rsquo;s father continued, &ldquo;while Joe Nara is going
around by the Rio Negro, turning north after he
passes Sao Gabriel. But we now know exactly where
to meet him. That will be at Piedra Del Cucuy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than floundering around the headwaters
of the Rio Negro,&rdquo; Whitman agreed. &ldquo;I was
afraid we would be on a wild goose chase, trying to
find him there. It&rsquo;s lucky that you met up with Nara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say that Nara met up with us,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster
chuckled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet again at Piedra Del Cucuy,
provided Nara dodges those head-hunters. Since the
rapids will delay him, we should reach the great
rock as soon as Nara does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to Luiz and see if he knows the best
route&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo; warned Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;Wait until we
are deep in the jungle, with no chance of any spies
being about, before we even mention Piedra Del
Cucuy. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final query was meant for Biff as well as Mr.
Whitman. Biff nodded, then went to join Kamuka,
who was waiting to help him get his pack on his back.
That done, they fell into the procession as it started
out.</p>
<p>The first few miles gave Biff the false impression
that a jungle trek was easy. The trail was smooth,
well-trodden by multitudes of natives who had
scoured the back country in search of <i>balata</i>. But as
paths diverged, they became rougher.</p>
<p>Biff began stumbling over big roots that crossed
the path, and when he kept his eyes turned down to
watch for them, he lost sight of the bearers ahead of
him and had trouble getting into line behind them.
Once, Biff lost the trail entirely, and Kamuka overtook
him just as he was blundering squarely into a
fallen tree.</p>
<p>The obstacle was at shoulder level, and Kamuka,
sighting the bearers taking a turn in the path beyond,
suggested: &ldquo;We climb over. Take short way back to
trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff pressed aside some projecting branches as he
clambered across the tree trunk, pack and all. His
hands became sticky with some clinging substance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spider web. Thick here,&rdquo; Kamuka said. He helped
Biff brush away the fine-spun threads, and pointed
into the sunlight that filtered through the jungle foliage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<div class="img">

<p class="caption"><i>Kamuka cleared the branches with hard, expert slashes</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Glistening between the tree branches were the
largest, thickest spider webs that Biff had ever seen.
There were multitudes of them, forming what at first
glance seemed an impassible barrier.</p>
<p>Kamuka settled that problem by clearing away the
obstructing branches with hard, expert slashes of his
machete, taking the webs with them.</p>
<p>The trail had become so irregular that the bearers
frequently had to hack their way through the thick
growth. Kamuka did the same, and Biff tried to copy
the Indian youth&rsquo;s smooth style. Kamuka handled his
machete easily, despite the pack that he carried. But
with Biff, the pack shifted at every swing, and its
straps cut into his back and shoulders.</p>
<p>Big Jacome was doing most of the trail blazing,
with Kamuka close behind him. Mr. Brewster and
Mr. Whitman did their share, while urging the bearers
to take their turns at the work. All responded
willingly, with the exception of the guide, Luiz, who
was lagging behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s holding you back, Luiz?&rdquo; Whitman demanded.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get up ahead and take a
hand at cutting the trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pay others to cut trail, Senhor,&rdquo; returned
Luiz. &ldquo;You pay me to be guide. <i>Nao?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s father overheard the argument and provided
a prompt solution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Since you are the guide,&rdquo; he told Luiz, &ldquo;suppose
you show us the trail. Possibly we have lost it. You
lead; we will follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster spoke in the Brazilian dialect that the
bearers understood. Their solemn faces broadened at
the expense of Luiz. Angrily, the undersized guide
shouldered his way to the head of the line and began
hacking at the brush with Jacome. Biff caught up
with Kamuka, who had waited while Luiz went by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see his face?&rdquo; asked Kamuka. &ldquo;Luiz is very
mad. He does not like hard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glower that Luiz gave over his shoulder
proved that Kamuka&rsquo;s opinion was correct. The keen-eyed
Indian boy was quick to note that Biff&rsquo;s face also
wore a pained expression, but for a different reason.
Understandingly, Kamuka said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have trouble with pack. I fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Expertly, he adjusted the straps to the fraction of
an inch. From then on, the pack seemed to fit to Biff&rsquo;s
back, giving him no more aches. What amazed Biff,
though, was the fact that Kamuka&rsquo;s pack had no
straps, but was laced to his back by crude ropes made
from jungle vines. Yet it seemed to adjust itself to
every move that Kamuka made.</p>
<p>Soon, the going became easier underfoot, and the
path was free of obstacles. It was no longer necessary
to hack through the jungle growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luiz bring us back to better trail,&rdquo; Kamuka confided
to Biff. &ldquo;Less work for Luiz.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>It was less work for Biff, too, though he didn&rsquo;t say
so. He was pleased because his father had handled the
situation so neatly. Biff noted the happy grins on the
faces of the bearers every time Mr. Brewster moved
back and forth among them. Biff grinned, too, when
his dad came by and gave him an encouraging whack
on the pack which now seemed molded to Biff&rsquo;s
body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes a few days to get into the swing of a
safari,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster stated, &ldquo;so don&rsquo;t be discouraged.
Even the native bearers are struggling a bit, though
they won&rsquo;t admit it. We&rsquo;ll call it a day as soon as we
reach a suitable campsite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About an hour later, the safari halted. Gratefully,
the bearers eased their packs to the ground and began
to set up camp at Whitman&rsquo;s direction, on a high
bank above a jungle stream. The insects were bothersome,
as they had been at intervals along the route,
but the expedition was equipped to meet that problem.
The packs contained netting for the sleeping hammocks,
as well as insect repellent.</p>
<p>The chief feature of the campsite was its closeness
to a water hole. Luiz approved this, making a great
show of his official title of guide. Biff, glad to be free
of his pack, eagerly volunteered to help Kamuka
bring up pails of water from the stream below. Halfway
down, Kamuka hissed for a quick halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go back up quick,&rdquo; he said to Biff. &ldquo;We tell
Senhor Brewster we see tapir at water hole.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Kamuka pointed out a pair of curious dark brown
animals, with clumsy, bulky bodies, stocky legs, and
long-snouted heads. The creatures were feeding on
the leaves of young trees and appeared somewhat
tame. Kamuka took no chance on frightening them
away, however, as he beckoned Biff up the path.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster promptly picked up a loaded rifle and
accompanied the boys down the path. The tapirs were
already lumbering into the brush when Biff&rsquo;s father
took quick but accurate aim on one of the animals and
fired.</p>
<p>One tapir dropped in its tracks, while its companion
crashed madly into the jungle. The boys rushed
down to the bank and found that the tapir was shot
squarely through the head. When Mr. Brewster joined
them, he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way to shoot a tapir,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;Otherwise, they blunder into the jungle wounded,
and you can never find them. They have thick hides
like a hippopotamus. In fact, they belong to the same
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, the members of the safari feasted on
tapir steaks, which they broiled on the prongs of
long, forked sticks. Later, they went to sleep around
the same campfire. All day, Biff had listened to the
chatter of monkeys and the screech of birds. Now,
howls of jungle animals seemed tuned to the heavy
basso chorus of frogs from the stream below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>But despite that, Biff was soon sound asleep, the
crackle of the campfire blending with his last waking
moments. Some hours later, he woke up suddenly.
The jungle concert had ended, and the flames had settled
to a low, subdued flicker. Somebody should have
tended the fire, Biff thought. He recalled his father
discussing that point with Luiz shortly after they had
finished dinner. Biff rolled from his hammock and
groped toward some logs that lay beside the fire.
There, he halted at sight of what appeared to be two
live coals, glinting from a big log.</p>
<p>Biff pulled back his hand just in time, as the log
came alive with a snarl. Biff realized that he had encountered
some prowling beast of prey. He raised
the alarm with a loud shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad! There&rsquo;s something here by the fire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Biff could complete the sentence, he saw
that the creature was a huge jungle cat, its tawny yellow
coat spotted black. Already, it was poising for a
spring. Biff, caught unarmed, was confronted by an
attacking jaguar, one of the jungle&rsquo;s most ferocious
killers.</p>
<p>Biff heard an answering call from his father. Then,
before Mr. Brewster could have possibly found time
to grab his gun, the jaguar sprang!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />Into the Quicksand</h2>
<p>Biff flung his arms upward, as he tried to duck
away. It was a hopeless effort, for nothing could have
saved him from those fierce claws, once the jaguar
reached him. What stopped the springing jungle cat
was another figure, small but chunky, that came flying
out of the darkness, feet first.</p>
<p>It was Kamuka. The Indian boy had grabbed a
long liana vine hanging like a rope from a tree beside
his high hammock. All in one motion, he had
swung himself across the jaguar&rsquo;s path just in time to
ram the creature&rsquo;s shoulder in mid-air and veer the
big cat toward the fire.</p>
<p>That gave Biff time enough to roll the other way,
and Kamuka, as he struck the ground, promptly
squirmed about to dive off into the darkness. The
scene was momentarily illuminated by a shower of
sparks raised by the jaguar when it struck the fringe
of the embers. With more of a yowl than a snarl, the
big cat cleared the fire at a single bound and took off
into the jungle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Mr. Brewster had his gun by then, but with so
many figures bouncing in the vague firelight, he
couldn&rsquo;t risk a shot. By the time Biff and Kamuka
were out of the way, Jacome had come on the scene,
swinging a big club. Mr. Brewster had to wait until he
was out of the path of aim, before firing into the jungle.</p>
<p>By then, Mr. Brewster might as well have fired
blank shots. The jaguar had vanished completely in
darkness. Jacome threw some logs on the fire, and as
the flames took hold, he commented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tapir tiger&mdash;that is what we call the jaguar.
A good name for him. Look there and you see why!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacome indicated a chunk of cooked tapir meat,
hanging from a tree branch near the fire. The smell
of its favorite food had evidently drawn the &ldquo;tapir
tiger&rdquo; in from the jungle. But that did not fully satisfy
Mr. Brewster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jaguars frequently kill and eat tapirs,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s father
declared, &ldquo;but they also shy away from campfires. I
gave orders that this fire should be tended all night.
Who neglected his duty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final words were addressed to Luiz, who had
just joined the group. The guide shrugged and gestured
to some of the native bearers who were coming
sleepily from their hammocks. They stared dumbly
at Luiz, until Mr. Brewster queried them sharply in
their dialect, getting headshakes from all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will give the orders direct from now on,&rdquo; Mr.
Brewster told Luiz bluntly, &ldquo;and I intend to see that
they are carried out.&rdquo; He looked up, noted the faint
glimmer of daybreak through the high leaves, and
added, &ldquo;It is after dawn. Let&rsquo;s break camp and start
on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff expressed his thanks to Kamuka while the Indian
boy was helping him prepare his pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t hopped to help me the way you
did,&rdquo; asserted Biff, &ldquo;I would be just a chunk of tapir
meat, or something a lot like it. I&rsquo;ll remember what
you did for me, Kamuka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; rejoined Kamuka solemnly. &ldquo;I help
you. You help me. That is the way in the jungle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff felt that he was getting the knack of jungle
ways during that day&rsquo;s trek, but he was due for new
surprises. As they hacked a path through a thick
growth of brush, he heard a sound that was sharply
distinct from the screeches of the vivid parrots and
macaws that continually scolded from the trees.</p>
<p>It was exactly like a hammer striking an anvil or
some other chunk of solid metal. It came from well
back in the jungle, and after it was repeated, Biff said
to Kamuka:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear that! There must be a village back there in
the jungle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka laughed as the clanging sound came again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>El campanero</i>,&rdquo; he defined. &ldquo;That is what some
people call it. Others call it the bellbird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it&rsquo;s only a bird?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>As if in answer, the sharp note was repeated with
methodical precision, and Biff recognized that it had a
quality that could be mistaken for a bell rather than
the clank of hammer on anvil. Biff kept looking for
the bird itself until Kamuka noticed it and told him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bellbird very hard to find. He may be far away
when you think he is close by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other creatures were closer at hand. From up
ahead, Jacome turned and pointed to the path. He
called something in his native tongue, and Biff
watched the bearers take quick sidesteps. Then Kamuka
was nudging Biff with his elbow and pointing
out the reason.</p>
<p>A procession of ants was moving along the trail as
though keeping pace with the safari. The insects were
carrying thin green slivers that wobbled above their
bodies. Biff saw that those were tiny fragments of
leaves that the ants had gathered and evidently were
going to store for food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umbrella ants,&rdquo; defined Kamuka. &ldquo;Be careful or
they crawl up your leg instead of along path. Umbrella
ants can bite&mdash;hard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the way the ants had chopped the leaves
they carried, Biff took Kamuka at his word. He
played hopscotch with the insects until they veered
off the trail. The going became easy again, except that
the atmosphere of the jungle was growing more humid.
Even the chatter of the birds and monkeys was
silenced in the sultry calm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Then came a sudden rain as torrential as the big
downpour that they had encountered on the Rio Negro.
With the jungle steam rising about them, it was a
case of groping along the trail, which soon became
ankle deep with water. As he sloshed through the
muck, Biff told Kamuka:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those ants are smarter than we are. They must
have known this was coming and carried their own
umbrellas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka interpreted that to Jacome, who laughed
and passed it along to the bearers. The rain stopped
suddenly at last, but although the heat returned again,
the path remained soggy underfoot. Luiz, it seemed,
had lost the trail during the rain and was marching
the safari into a jungle swamp.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster called a halt. It was not just a matter
of getting back on the trail; he wanted the best trail.
For the first time, Biff heard his father mention
&ldquo;Piedra Del Cucuy&rdquo; to Luiz, who nodded that he understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go to Piedra Del Cucuy,&rdquo; assured Luiz. &ldquo;That
is easy, now I know. I show you the best way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s clothes were dry by now except for his shoes
and socks, which felt as if they were filled with lead
weights as the march was resumed. Luiz soon took
the safari out of the swampy land to a dry path, but
at times, he showed hesitancy at places where the
trail divided. Always, he came finally to a definite decision,
but Jacome began to eye him suspiciously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;We all hear Senhor Brewster say we go to Piedra
Del Cucuy,&rdquo; Jacome confided to Biff and Kamuka.
&ldquo;Now we know we go there, Luiz is afraid to take us
on wrong trail. Some of us go to Piedra Del Cucuy before
this. We may remember way if Luiz &lsquo;forget&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later, Biff fell in stride alongside his dad
and told him what Jacome had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s no question but that Luiz is trying
to delay us,&rdquo; declared Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;The only puzzle
is his purpose. He may simply be hoping to make
more money by keeping us longer on the hike. Or
he may have deliberately stalled us in order to learn
our exact destination. That is why I told him. Now, I
am forcing him to show his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s tactics paid off by mid-afternoon.
The ringing cry of the bellbird had begun again in
the deep jungle, and Biff was still hoping for a sight
of the elusive <i>campanero</i>, when Luiz led the safari on
a short side trail that terminated in a clearing. There
Luiz announced, &ldquo;We camp here tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could still go on a few miles farther,&rdquo; objected
Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;In fact, we might stop almost anywhere
on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of water here,&rdquo; argued Luiz. &ldquo;Maybe not
in other places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacome overheard that. The big man supplied a
grim but knowing grin as he muttered his own opinion
to the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe and maybe not,&rdquo; said Jacome. &ldquo;In wet
season, we find water everywhere; in dry season, no.
But we came through big rain today, like wet season.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>After brief deliberation, Mr. Brewster gave Luiz
the nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need water,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;and perhaps we are
too tired to go on much farther today. We will make
camp here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had they unloaded their packs before
Kamuka suggested to Biff, &ldquo;Come with me. Maybe
we find bellbird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started along a twisty jungle path in the general
direction of the distant metallic sound. Kamuka
was moving so hurriedly that they were out of sight
of camp before Biff caught up with him and reminded
him, &ldquo;They may want to send us for water,
back at camp&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can wait,&rdquo; put in Kamuka. &ldquo;We find bird
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you told me before that there was no use
looking for the bellbird, that the sound might be far
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But this is not real bellbird. Listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff listened. The sharp note came clear again,
from exactly the same direction. Biff could detect no
difference between it and the anvil chorus of earlier
in the day. But Kamuka could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is hitting metal with hammer,&rdquo; the Indian
boy insisted. &ldquo;We look for them. We find them&mdash;if
we hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Kamuka waved his arm for Biff to follow, as he
started a quick jog along the jungle path, hoping to
reach the source of the well-faked bird call before the
sounds ceased. Straight ahead, low tree branches
formed a thick green arch, darkening the path between
two low banks that were vivid with colorful
flowers.</p>
<p>Mostly, they were magnificent orchids that thrived
on dampness as well as heat, but Biff was unaware of
that. Kamuka, though schooled in jungle knowledge,
ignored the flowers in his haste. He had turned his
head to see if Biff had responded to his call, when
suddenly, the green carpeting of the path gave way
beneath his weight.</p>
<p>A moment later, Kamuka was waist deep in slimy
ooze, squirming, twisting about to grab at bushes on
the solid ground that he had left. The tufts of grass
that he clutched simply pulled loose from the soft
earth. With each quickly repeated snatch, he had still
less chance of gaining a hold, for he was sinking to his
armpits as he panted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Biff! Don&rsquo;t come close! Quicksand!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />The Deadly Coils</h2>
<p>Biff stopped a dozen feet short of the spot where
Kamuka, arms emerging from the mire, was frantically
waving him back. Biff felt the soft bank giving
way beneath him, and he immediately sprang back to
solid ground, knowing that only from there could he
hope to save his friend.</p>
<p>Kamuka was still sinking in the quicksand, though
more slowly now. That gave Biff a few more minutes
in which to help him; but how to help was still a
question. There was no use throwing a liana vine to
Kamuka; it would be too flimsy. A tree branch would
be better, but the only boughs strong enough to support
a person&rsquo;s weight were those that overhung the
mire itself.</p>
<p>Biff couldn&rsquo;t wrench those branches loose from
their trunks in time to save Kamuka. In fact, to push
anything out from the bank looked like a hopeless
plan. The best way to help would be by a pull straight
up. Biff realized that, when he saw Kamuka look up
toward the lowest bough, six feet or more above his
head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p003.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="745" />
<p class="caption"><i>Biff felt the soft bank giving way beneath him</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>If only Kamuka could reach that far!</p>
<p>That thought gave Biff the answer. Skirting the
quicksand, he climbed one of the trees and started
working out on its lowest thick branch, hand over
hand, toward the spot where Kamuka, now nearly
shoulder-deep in the muck, still looked up hopefully.</p>
<p>So far, Biff had been worrying whether the bough
would prove strong enough. Now he was wishing
that it would bend more. Biff was dangling near
Kamuka, but not quite above him; and it was impossible
for the Indian boy to shift his position in the
quicksand. But Biff was able to do the next best thing.</p>
<p>Locking his hands over the thick branch, Biff began
a pendulum swing, out and back&mdash;out and back&mdash;bringing
his ankles closer to Kamuka&rsquo;s reach. Kamuka
made one clutch and missed, but on the next swing
Biff practically placed his ankle in the Indian boy&rsquo;s
grasp.</p>
<p>Kamuka caught Biff&rsquo;s other ankle in the same fashion,
and Biff, slanting a glance downward, saw the
other boy&rsquo;s face smiling grimly from between those
upstretched arms. Kamuka&rsquo;s voice came calmly.
&ldquo;Hold tight, Biff. I will pull up slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Biff was glad that the bough was a stout one,
for he could feel it give under Kamuka&rsquo;s added
weight. Biff tried to work himself higher by bending
his arms and turning them along the branch, so that
he could use his hands to grip his opposite wrists.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>That helped at first, but Kamuka&rsquo;s weight kept increasing
as he emerged gradually from the ooze, and
the strain made Biff&rsquo;s shoulders feel as if they would
pull from their sockets. But by then, Kamuka had
worked clear of the quicksand&rsquo;s suction. He caught
Biff&rsquo;s belt with one hand; then the other. Next, he
was clamping Biff&rsquo;s shoulder and finally the tree
branch.</p>
<p>The strain lessened then, with both boys dangling
from the bough. Practically side by side, they made a
hand-over-hand trip toward the tree trunk and
dropped to solid ground. There they sat a moment,
panting and rubbing their shoulders as they looked at
each other, a bit bewildered by their short but strenuous
adventure.</p>
<p>From the distance came that clear metallic note
that they had heard before. Kamuka looked at Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still go find it&mdash;maybe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Kamuka. Let&rsquo;s go find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They skirted the quicksand and took the path that
Kamuka had missed in his hurry. It divided into lesser
paths, but they continued to pick a course in the general
direction of the clanging sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody use that for a signal,&rdquo; declared Kamuka.
&ldquo;When we find it, you will see that I am right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> right,&rdquo; Biff whispered. &ldquo;Look there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A figure had cut into the path well ahead of them
and was continuing on. Softly, Kamuka whispered
the name: &ldquo;Luiz!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The boys were fortunate. Luiz hadn&rsquo;t spotted them.
Evidently, the guide had left the camp by another
path and had followed a roundabout course to reach
his present goal. Luiz, judging by the eager expression
on his scheming face, was also following the call of
the false bellbird. Cautiously, the boys took up Luiz&rsquo;s
trail until he reached a clearing. There, they sidled
into a patch of jungle and spread the foliage just
enough to view the open space in front of them.</p>
<p>A big man was sitting on a camp stool beside a tent.
In front of him was a small anvil, and he gave it a
ringing stroke with a hammer as the boys watched.
Kamuka was the first to recognize the hawkish face
that turned in Luiz&rsquo;s direction as the guide approached.</p>
<p>Kamuka whispered, &ldquo;Urubu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff had scarcely noticed Urubu. Instead, he was
staring in total amazement at two other men who had
come from the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of those men is Nicholas Serbot,&rdquo; he told
Kamuka. &ldquo;The other is his sidekick, Big Pepito. But
they were in Manaus, the night we left there. How
did they get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Airplane come upriver ahead of you,&rdquo; replied
Kamuka. &ldquo;Stop at <i>maloca</i> near rubber camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By <i>maloca</i> Kamuka meant a native village some distance
back from the Rio Negro. Quickly, Biff exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where they met Urubu! They must have
paid him to make trouble for us!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Kamuka gave a chuckle. &ldquo;Look like they pay Luiz,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Urubu was introducing Luiz to Serbot and Pepito.
In the background were several native bearers, apparently
under orders to keep their distance. Serbot
and Pepito were watching them to make sure they
did. Biff took advantage of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can move up closer,&rdquo; he told Kamuka. &ldquo;Maybe
close enough to hear what they are saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka silently agreed, for he crawled along with
Biff until they reached the very fringe of the thinner
brush, only a dozen yards from where the four men
stood. There, Kamuka whispered, &ldquo;This far enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grass here was tall and studded with brilliant
flowers and shrubs that had cropped up since the
brush was thinned. By keeping almost flat on their
stomachs, the boys remained completely hidden. Most
of the discussion was in Portuguese, with a sprinkling
of dialect, so between them Biff and Kamuka were
able to understand most of what was said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come for money, Senhor,&rdquo; Luiz told Serbot.
&ldquo;Like Urubu said you would give me if I delay safari.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will get your money later,&rdquo; promised Serbot.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t spend it here in the jungle anyway. If you
even showed it, Brewster and Whitman would wonder
where it came from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luiz started to babble an objection, only to have
Urubu interrupt him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have only done half your job, Luiz,&rdquo; Urubu
reminded him. &ldquo;You gave our safari time to catch up
with yours. Now you must see that we have time to
get ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that,&rdquo; injected Luiz, &ldquo;I should be paid
double.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be,&rdquo; agreed Serbot, &ldquo;if you can tell us
where Brewster intends to go, so we can get there
ahead of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff saw Luiz&rsquo;s teeth gleam in a knowing smile.
The small guide spoke in dialect to Urubu, who made
a prompt reply. Kamuka understood the talk and
whispered to Biff:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luiz says he can tell them what they want to
know. He asks Urubu if he can trust them. Urubu
says yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By then, Luiz had turned to Serbot. Biff&rsquo;s heart
sank as he heard Luiz triumphantly announce:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They go to Piedra Del Cucuy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big boundary rock!&rdquo; exclaimed Serbot. &ldquo;That
must have been Nara&rsquo;s boat that took Brewster and
the boy up the river. Now, they probably plan to
meet Nara there.&rdquo; He turned to Urubu. &ldquo;Can you
get us to Piedra Del Cucuy first?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily,&rdquo; assured Urubu, &ldquo;if Luiz takes them the
long way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I should leave them,&rdquo; put in Luiz, &ldquo;and
come with you. Then they will have no guide and
will not find the way at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;That would be all right,&rdquo; decided Serbot, &ldquo;but
learn what else you can first. Did Brewster mention
the name Nara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nao</i>, Senhor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say anything about a map?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nao</i>, Senhor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find out what you can about both. If you can get
word to us, good. If Brewster becomes suspicious, join
us. But your big job is to delay their safari. Use whatever
way seems best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That ended the parley, except for parting words
from Urubu to Luiz, which greatly interested the listening
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, I signal before we start.&rdquo; Urubu gestured
toward the hammer and anvil. &ldquo;If you do not
come to join us, we will know you are staying with
the safari&mdash;to guide them the long way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Urubu and Luiz were turning in the direction of
the spot where the boys lay hidden. Biff whispered to
Kamuka:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s crawl out of here fast&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay still!&rdquo; Kamuka&rsquo;s interruption came as a warning
hiss. &ldquo;Do not move&mdash;not one inch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff let his eyes turn in the direction of Kamuka&rsquo;s
stare. Despite the intense heat of the jungle, Biff could
actually feel himself freeze. Coming straight toward
them through the tall grass was the head of a huge
snake!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Behind it, the grass rippled from the slithering coils
that followed. Fully twenty feet in length, the gigantic
creature could only be an anaconda, greatest of
all boa constrictors.</p>
<p>To be caught within those crushing coils would
mean sure death!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />A Traitor Strikes</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do not move&mdash;not one inch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka repeated that warning as the snake&rsquo;s long
body slid slowly past. Whether or not the creature
was in search of other prey, to move would be to attract
it. Biff realized that from Kamuka&rsquo;s tone as well
as his words.</p>
<p>Gradually, the sliding coils slackened speed. It was
Biff who spoke now, his own voice strained, but
low:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s turning now, Kamuka. It may be coming
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but stay still. One move, you are gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite himself, Biff raised his head, only slightly,
but enough to look beyond the long, hoselike body
that was still gliding by. Aloud, Biff groaned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Luiz&mdash;coming straight toward us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Biff threw up his arms to ward off the great boa&rsquo;s
tail as it lashed past. Looking up, he saw the snake&rsquo;s
huge mouth yawning toward him. Biff shut his eyes,
thinking there was no hope now. Then a wild scream
came from just ahead.</p>
<p>Biff and Kamuka bobbed up from the grass and
saw what had happened. The anaconda, on the rove
for prey, had lashed out for the first moving thing
that approached it&mdash;Luiz. Caught in the snake&rsquo;s coils,
the guide was shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Urubu! <i>Ajudo! Ajudo!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Urubu took one quick look and relayed the call
for help. Serbot and Pepito came from the tent, saw
what was happening, and dashed back for their guns.
Biff didn&rsquo;t wait to watch what followed. He grabbed
Kamuka&rsquo;s arm and exclaimed, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went. Behind them, they heard a burst of
gunfire. Those first shots must have wounded the
anaconda or frightened it away, for the next volley
whistled through the foliage as Biff and Kamuka
dived into the jungle. The boys found their path and
raced along it until the shooting dwindled far behind
them.</p>
<p>Breathless, they slackened their pace to a walk and
talked over what had happened. In a worried tone,
Biff said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have seen us or they wouldn&rsquo;t have
fired after us. I hope they didn&rsquo;t know who we were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely,&rdquo; observed Kamuka seriously, &ldquo;I
think they don&rsquo;t know what we were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean they mistook us for some jungle animals?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? We were gone quick&mdash;<i>pouf</i>! Maybe we
were gone quicker than <i>sucuria</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By &ldquo;sucuria&rdquo; Kamuka meant the anaconda. He was
referring to the giant water boa by its more popular
Brazilian name. Kamuka&rsquo;s comment brought a smile
from Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if they shot the anaconda,&rdquo; he speculated,
&ldquo;or whether it managed to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Luiz will tell us,&rdquo; rejoined Kamuka, grinning,
&ldquo;when he gets back to our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Luiz ever gets back there at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys lost no time in getting back to camp
themselves. There, they told Mr. Brewster and Mr.
Whitman all that had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serbot must have learned a lot from somebody
down in Minas Geraes,&rdquo; decided Mr. Brewster,
&ldquo;though how, I can&rsquo;t quite understand. I checked everyone
who had talked with Lew Kirby, and I felt
sure he had confided in me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did Serbot hear about Joe Nara?&rdquo; queried
Mr. Whitman. &ldquo;There have been rumors of head-hunters
and abandoned rubber plantations off in the
jungle. But no talk of prospectors and gold mines&mdash;at
least none that reached me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were rumors farther up the river,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s
father said, &ldquo;according to what Nara told us. When
Joe bought that cruiser and came down to Manaus,
he turned rumor into fact.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nara found out about us,&rdquo; Hal Whitman pointed
out, &ldquo;so why shouldn&rsquo;t Serbot find out about Nara?
Or about us, for that matter? We know now where
the leak came. Through Urubu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster weighed that statement, then slowly
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Urubu couldn&rsquo;t have sent word to Serbot that
fast,&rdquo; he declared, then, turning to Biff, he queried:
&ldquo;You are sure Serbot told Luiz to find out what he
could about Nara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Biff, &ldquo;and about the map, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it wasn&rsquo;t Serbot&rsquo;s man who stole the map,&rdquo;
mused Mr. Brewster, &ldquo;unless he wants that missing
corner that I still have. Or else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster interrupted himself, as sounds of excitement
came from the bearers, who were busy
thatching palm leaves to form a shelter. Their babble
of dialect included the name &ldquo;Luiz,&rdquo; and a couple of
the bearers were running to help the guide as he came
limping into camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say nothing,&rdquo; warned Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;Just listen
to what Luiz has to tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luiz had plenty to tell when they formed a sympathetic
group around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look for water hole,&rdquo; Luiz told them, &ldquo;and I
meet <i>una grande sucuria</i>&mdash;one big anaconda! He grab
me around my body, like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Graphically, Luiz gestured to indicate how the
snake&rsquo;s coils had encircled his body.</p>
<p>Biff and Kamuka kept straight, solemn faces as
Luiz continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;I pull my gun quick!&rdquo; Luiz thrust his hand deep
in his trouser pocket and brought out a small revolver.
&ldquo;I fire quick, until the gun is empty.&rdquo; He clicked the
trigger repeatedly; then broke open the revolver and
showed its empty chambers. &ldquo;Still, anaconda hold
me, until I draw knife and stab him hard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a sheath at the back of his belt, Luiz whipped
out a knife that looked far more formidable than his
puny gun. He gave fierce stabs at the imaginary anaconda,
his face gleaming with an ugly smile that was
more vicious than triumphant. Luiz looked like a small
edition of Urubu, whose ways he seemed to copy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big snake go off into jungle,&rdquo; added Luiz, wiggling
his hand ahead of him to indicate the anaconda&rsquo;s
writhing course. &ldquo;Hurt bad, I think. Maybe it is dead
by now. But the animals were still afraid of it. I hear
them run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sharp eyes darted from Biff to Kamuka, but
neither boy changed expression. Clumsily, Luiz pocketed
the revolver with his left hand and thrust the
knife smoothly back into its sheath with his right.
He rubbed his side painfully, then beckoned to two of
the natives and said, &ldquo;We go look for water hole
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short while later, the boys had a chance to exchange
comments while they were gathering palm
fronds for the shelter. After making sure that no one
else was nearby, Kamuka confided:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luiz had no gun at start of safari. Urubu must
have given gun to him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;To explain the shots if any of our party heard
them!&rdquo; exclaimed Biff. &ldquo;And did you see the way
Luiz looked at us when he mentioned scared animals?
Maybe they glimpsed us going into the brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; agreed Kamuka. &ldquo;I think they shoot anaconda,
or big <i>sucuria</i> would not let Luiz go so easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another reason why Luiz claimed he shot
it,&rdquo; added Biff. &ldquo;We might come across the anaconda
and find the bullet marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, the boys found a chance to repeat
those opinions to Mr. Brewster, who added a few
points that they had overlooked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luiz couldn&rsquo;t possibly have brought the gun from
his pocket, as he claimed,&rdquo; stated Mr. Brewster, &ldquo;because
the snake was already coiled about his body.
For that matter, he could not have drawn his knife,
either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, from the clumsy way he showed us the
gun and put it back in the wrong pocket, you could
tell he had never handled it before. In contrast, he
was smooth and quick with his knife, which is obviously
his customary weapon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One question still perplexed Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That other camp is a good way off, Dad,&rdquo; Biff
said, &ldquo;yet we heard the anvil strokes before we started
out. How come you didn&rsquo;t hear the gunfire later?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Urubu may have made the first strokes closer by,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;The anvil sound is also sharper
than a gunshot and should carry farther. That is probably
why they chose it as a signal. Kamuka did well
to detect it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening, Biff was glad there had been time to
build the thatched shelter, for a tropical dew had begun
to settle, almost as thick as a dripping rain. It was
less damp beneath the shelter, where Biff and Kamuka
had slung their hammocks.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster, however, had inflated a rubber mattress
and had placed it near the fire, stating that he
would use a poncho to keep off the moisture. From
his hammock, Biff watched his dad arrange small logs
and palm stalks as spare fuel. As he closed his eyes,
Biff could hear his father talking to Luiz, who was
standing close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will watch the fire tonight,&rdquo; announced Mr.
Brewster. &ldquo;You have been hurt. You need rest more
than I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Senhor,&rdquo; objected Luiz. &ldquo;Suppose you fall
asleep&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure to wake up at intervals. I always do.
But you must get some sleep, Luiz. We need you to
guide us to Piedra Del Cucuy. You are sure you know
the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly, Senhor. But it may take longer
than you expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause&mdash;then Mr. Brewster asked bluntly,
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because the shortest way is not the best way,&rdquo;
returned Luiz. &ldquo;We might meet floods, or streams
where the piranha may attack us. They are very dangerous
fish, the piranha&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Brewster impatiently,
&ldquo;but we have no time to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are meeting someone at Piedra Del Cucuy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;A man named&mdash;&rdquo;
He caught himself, then said in a blunt tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t know our plans until we get there. We
will continue on up the river. That is all that I can
tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have a map, Senhor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff opened his eyes at Luiz&rsquo;s question. He saw his
father start to reach into his inside pocket, then bring
his hand out empty. Shaking his head, Mr. Brewster
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have no map. Go get some sleep, Luiz. You
will need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff glimpsed Luiz&rsquo;s face as the sneaky guide turned
from the firelight. Beneath the hatbrim, Luiz wore
that same ugly smile that showed his satisfaction. Obviously,
Luiz was planning his next move, probably
for tomorrow.</p>
<p>When it came, his father would be ready for it,
Biff felt sure. Soon Biff drifted into a fitful sleep from
which he awoke at intervals. Sometimes he heard the
crackle of the fire and decided that his father must
have thrown on a log and then gone back to sleep.
For, each time, Biff saw the figure of Mr. Brewster
covered by the rubber poncho, near the pile of logs
that had become much smaller during the night. It
must have been the fourth or fifth awakening, when
Biff saw someone move into the firelight&rsquo;s flicker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>It was Luiz. He crept forward. Crouched above
the quiet form, Luiz thrust his hand downward as if
to reach into the sleeper&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p>The figure under the poncho seemed to stir. Luiz recoiled
quickly and sped his hand to his hip. Before Biff
could shout a warning, Luiz had whipped out his long
knife into sight and driven it straight down at the
helpless shape beneath him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />The Shrunken Heads</h2>
<p>Wildly, Biff tumbled from his hammock to the
soggy ground. Coming to his hands and knees, he
started forward just as another figure sprang into the
firelight, too late to halt Luiz&rsquo;s knife. The newcomer
grabbed Luiz&rsquo;s shoulders and spun the little man full
about. For a moment, Luiz poised his blade as though
planning to counter the attack.</p>
<p>Instead, he uttered an unearthly shriek, as though
he had seen a ghost. Biff was startled, too, but his cry
was a glad one. Etched against the firelight, Biff saw
his dad&rsquo;s face looking down at Luiz.</p>
<p>Tom Brewster himself was the man who had interrupted
Luiz&rsquo;s deadly work. The figure under the
poncho, Biff realized, must be a dummy.</p>
<p>As the two men struggled for possession of the
knife, they kicked the dummy apart with their feet.
Suddenly Luiz managed to wrench free and dashed
off into the jungle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Mr. Brewster didn&rsquo;t bother to start after the terrified
guide. But Hal Whitman came rushing from the
shelter waving a revolver. Mr. Whitman fired a few
wild shots in the direction that Luiz had taken. The
crackling of jungle plants came back like echoes, indicating
that the gunfire had spurred Luiz&rsquo;s mad
flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Hal,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;The
fellow is so badly scared he won&rsquo;t stop running until
he reaches Serbot&rsquo;s camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the more he runs,&rdquo; returned Mr. Whitman,
&ldquo;the more difficulty he will have finding it in the
dark. Well, if Luiz gets lost in the jungle, he won&rsquo;t
talk to Serbot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it matters much, Hal. Luiz has already
told Serbot all he knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except that we found out his game. Now he will
tell that to Serbot, too&mdash;if he finds him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the flickering firelight, Biff saw his father&rsquo;s face
take on a troubled expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Hal,&rdquo; decided Mr. Brewster grimly.
&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. It would be better to catch
Luiz and take him along with us. It&rsquo;s probably too late
now, but it may be worth a try.&rdquo; Mr. Brewster turned
to Jacome. &ldquo;Call Luiz, and see if he answers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacome gave a long call: &ldquo;Luiz! Luiz!&rdquo; Faintly,
like a faraway echo, a voice responded: &ldquo;<i>Ajudo!
Ajudo!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>In the firelight, Biff and Kamuka exchanged
startled glances. Both had the same sudden thought,
but it was Biff who exclaimed, &ldquo;The quicksand!
Luiz must have taken the same path that we did this
afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacome was calling &ldquo;Luiz!&rdquo; again, but this time
there was no response. Mr. Brewster gave the prompt
order:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring lights and hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the way the path showed in the gleam of
their flashlights, it was plain that Luiz could have followed
it rapidly in the dark, for it formed the only
opening through the brush. Biff and Kamuka, racing
along beside Jacome, were the first to reach the arch
of trees above the quicksand.</p>
<p>They halted there, but saw no sign of a human figure
in the muck. The glare revealed nothing but floating
water flowers until big Jacome pointed out what
appeared to be a lily pad. Biff exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luiz&rsquo;s hat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was lying brim downward in the ooze, beyond
the bough from which Biff had rescued Kamuka. This
time it was Kamuka who scrambled along the branch
and used a big stick that Jacome tossed him to prod
the quicksand, but with no result.</p>
<p>From the bank, Mr. Brewster studied the scene
grimly, noting that the farther out Kamuka jabbed
the stick, the easier and deeper it went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cry from Luiz was his last,&rdquo; decided Mr.
Brewster. &ldquo;In his flight, he must have plunged much
farther than Kamuka did this afternoon. That is why
the quicksand swallowed him much faster.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>From the bank, Jacome and other natives dragged
the mire with stones attached to long liana vines, but
received no answering tugs from the pulpy quicksand.
When they pushed long sticks down into the mire,
they went completely out of sight, to stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reclaiming anything lost in those
depths,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s father said soberly. &ldquo;That goes for
Luiz, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they returned to the campsite, Mr. Brewster
dismantled the crude dummy that he had placed beside
the fire. It was formed from wads of grass, palm
stalks, and small logs, which had made it bulky enough
to be mistaken for a sleeping figure in the uncertain
firelight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what you told me,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster said to
Biff and Kamuka, &ldquo;I decided to test Luiz. I did everything
but mention Joe Nara by name. I made this
dummy figure so I could watch Luiz if he tried to
steal the map he had been told I carried. At the same
time, I was guarding my life against his treachery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Dad!&rdquo; exclaimed Biff. &ldquo;Serbot never told
Luiz to kill you. He simply told him to delay our
safari.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to Luiz&rsquo;s way of thinking,&rdquo; declared Mr.
Brewster, &ldquo;the simplest way of accomplishing that
would be by killing me. Here in the jungle, people
think and act in very direct terms, particularly the natives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Mr. Brewster and Mr. Whitman began a discussion
of the next steps to be taken. They agreed that the
sooner the safari moved along, the better. Mr. Brewster
put a question to Jacome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been to Piedra Del Cucuy before, Jacome.
Could you find your way there again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, Senhor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will be our guide as far as the big rock.
Have the bearers ready to move at dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daylight was tinting the vast canopy of jungle
leaves when the safari started back toward the main
trail. The setting was somber at this early hour, but
the silence was soon broken by some scattered jungle
cries. Then, clear and sharp, came the metallic note
of the bellbird. Mr. Brewster waved the safari to a
stop and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The call was repeated. Mr. Brewster turned to
Kamuka and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of bird is that? <i>Campanero</i> or Urubu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff smiled at the way his father used the term for
&ldquo;bellbird&rdquo; along with Urubu&rsquo;s nickname of &ldquo;vulture.&rdquo;
But Kamuka kept a very serious face as he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Urubu. Look, Senhor. I show you why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to a white-feathered bird that formed
a tiny spot on the high branch of a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is real <i>campanero</i>,&rdquo; declared Kamuka. &ldquo;He
is saying nothing. He would answer if he heard real
call.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Mr. Brewster studied the bellbird through a pair of
binoculars and promptly agreed with Kamuka. He
handed the glasses to Biff, who noted that the bird,
which was something like a waxwing, but larger, had
an appendage that extended from its forehead and
draped down over its bill. This ornament, jet-black
in color, was starred with tiny tufts of feathers. Mr.
Brewster called it a caruncle and explained that it was
commonly seen on various species of tropical birds
noted for their ringing cries.</p>
<p>But this bellbird remained silent, even when the
distant anvil sound clanged anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Urubu is signaling for Luiz,&rdquo; declared Mr. Brewster.
&ldquo;He may wait an hour or so and try again.
When Serbot finally decides that we have moved on,
he will think that Luiz is taking us the long way. We
should get a good head start, right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The safari pressed forward at a quick pace which
was maintained most of the day. The going was not
as hard as Biff had anticipated. Luiz&rsquo;s talk of a tough
trail had been a sham, so that the party would be willing
to take the long route.</p>
<p>Even some of the streams they encountered were
already bridged with fallen trees, making crossing
easy. After one such crossing, Jacome suggested stopping
to eat. Mr. Brewster opened some canned goods,
but most of the bearers preferred bowls of coarse
cereal, made from the manioc or cassava plant. This
formed their chief diet.</p>
<p>Jacome gnawed on a large bone of left-over tapir
meat. When he had finished half of the meat, he suddenly
tossed the bone into the stream. Instantly, the
water flashed with silvery streaks in the shape of long,
sleek fish that fought for the bone and tore the remaining
meat to shreds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Piranha,&rdquo; grunted Jacome. &ldquo;They rip anybody
who goes in water. If we chop away tree, Urubu will
have to stop to build new bridge to get across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serbot might suspect something,&rdquo; objected Mr.
Brewster. &ldquo;If they guess that we are on the same trail
<i>ahead</i> of them, they will hurry. It is better to let them
think that they can take their time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacome still found time to fish for piranha during
the short rest. The cannibal fish practically leaped
from the water to take the bait. Jacome took no
chances with the sharp teeth that projected from
their bulldog jaws. He cut the lines and tossed the
fish into a basket, hooks and all. When the safari made
camp at dusk, they cooked the piranha, and the fish
proved a tasty dinner, indeed.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster kept the safari at a steady pace
during the next few days in order to stay ahead of
Serbot&rsquo;s party. Jacome proved an excellent guide,
remembering every landmark along the trail. One
afternoon, a rain ended as they trudged beside the
bank of a sluggish stream and Jacome pointed into the
distance with the comment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big rock. There.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>It was Piedra Del Cucuy, a huge, stumpy shaft of
granite, towering hundreds of feet above the forest.
The rock was streaked with tiny trees that looked
like sprinklings from the vast green vegetation that
spread beneath. Though the natural boundary marker
was still a day&rsquo;s march away, the mere sight of it
spurred on the safari.</p>
<p>In the light of dawn, the big rock seemed much
closer, and within a few hours&rsquo; trek, even its cracks
and furrows showed sharply. Trails began to join, and
suddenly the trees spread as the safari emerged upon
a sandy beach lapped by the black water of the Rio
Negro.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a sign of a boat nor of any habitation
until Kamuka pointed to a movement in the brush, a
few hundred feet downstream. Mr. Brewster stepped
forward, spreading his arms with a wide sweep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Joe Nara,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster told Biff, &ldquo;he will
recognize us. If not, be ready to get back to shelter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two figures bobbed into sight, and Biff recognized
the squatty forms of Igo and Ubi. They turned and
gestured. A few moments later they were joined by
Joe Nara. All three came forward to meet the safari.
Nara was carrying a small package under his arm.</p>
<p>The bearers were laying down their packs and
other equipment when Nara cried excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hoped it would be you, Brewster, but we
weren&rsquo;t sure. The Macus have been attacking villages
up and down the river. Everywhere, we have heard
the cry: &lsquo;Macu! Macu!&rsquo; until we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it, Nara,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;We have
more important things to talk about first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>The native bearers were coming forward silently,
and Biff realized that they were drawn by that
dreaded word, Macu. But Mr. Brewster wasn&rsquo;t able
to hush Joe Nara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more important than Macu head-hunters?&rdquo;
the old man demanded. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe me,
Brewster, look at what I picked up downriver!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Mr. Brewster could stop him, Joe Nara
ripped open the package that he carried. Under the
eyes of the native bearers who now were crowding
close about him, Nara brought out a pair of shrunken
human heads, triumphantly displaying one in each
hand!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />Trapped by the Head-hunters</h2>
<p>From the babble that followed, Biff realized that
the damage had been done. The bearers shied away as
though the tiny heads were alive and ready to attack
them. They made a hurried retreat toward the
trail from which the safari had come. Out of their excited
chatter, Biff could distinguish the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macu here! We go home&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff, meanwhile, was studying the shrunken heads
in amazement. Reduced to the size of baseballs, their
human appearance was preserved in miniature form.
Cords closed the lips, and feathered ornaments hung
from the ears of these grotesque trophies.</p>
<p>Though Biff had heard how head-hunters dealt with
their victims, he had thought of shrunken heads as
curios rather than as something gruesome. But here,
on a tropical riverbank, where the deadly Macus
might pop up in person, the grisly trophies were fearful
things indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>When Biff looked from the tiny heads in Nara&rsquo;s
hands to the scared faces of the clustered natives, he
noted a striking similarity between them. He knew
that the natives saw it, too, each picturing himself as
a head-hunter&rsquo;s prospective victim. Mr. Whitman and
Jacome were trying to quiet the wild babble but to no
avail. Mr. Brewster gestured to the shrunken heads
and told Nara:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put those away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Joe wrapped the souvenirs with a chuckle, as
though he relished the confusion he had caused.
Jacome approached and spoke solemnly to Mr. Brewster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no good,&rdquo; Jacome said. &ldquo;They want pay.
They want to go back to Santa Isabel&mdash;far away
from Macu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you, Jacome?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Brewster.
&ldquo;Do you want to go with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go, yes,&rdquo; admitted Jacome, &ldquo;but I want
more to stay with you. So I stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster turned to Kamuka. &ldquo;And you,
Kamuka?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stay with Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; Biff clapped Kamuka on the shoulder.
&ldquo;I knew a couple of little shrunken heads wouldn&rsquo;t
scare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen such heads before,&rdquo; rejoined Kamuka
calmly, &ldquo;but always heads of men. Never any head of
a boy. So why should heads scare me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Mr. Brewster paid off the bearers in Brazilian <i>cruzeiro</i>
notes, saying he would give them double if they
stayed with the safari, but there were no takers. In
English, Mr. Whitman undertoned the suggestion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep talking to them. They still may stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it must be voluntary,&rdquo; returned Mr. Brewster,
&ldquo;as with Jacome and Kamuka. Otherwise, they will
desert us later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bearers hastily packed their few belongings,
took a supply of food, and started back along the
trail. Mr. Brewster remarked to Joe Nara, &ldquo;Now I
suppose we shall have to go upriver in the <i>Xanadu</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Nara. &ldquo;We had to haul the
cruiser up on shore below the big rapids. The friendly
natives who helped were the ones who told us about
the Macus and gave us the shrunken heads. We&rsquo;ve
come the rest of the way in a canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nara paused and gestured down the riverbank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hid it there,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;so we could wait for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have rubber boats in our equipment,&rdquo; stated
Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;We can inflate them for the trip upriver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are many more rapids,&rdquo; objected Nara,
&ldquo;with no natives to help you carry the boats past
them. You will have to go overland by a back trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will we find new bearers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From a native village a mile or so in there.&rdquo; Nara
gestured to another jungle path. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send Igo and
Ubi along to introduce you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Mr. Brewster delegated the task of hiring the bearers
to Hal Whitman, who left, accompanied by Jacome
and Nara&rsquo;s two Wai Wai Indians. Biff and
Kamuka took a swim in the safe water of the river.
As they sat drying themselves in the sun, the boys
watched Nara describe the route to Mr. Brewster.
With a stick, old Joe drew a wiggly line in the sand
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This here is the Rio Negro. I keep going up it until
I turn east on another river.&rdquo; Nara made a line that
wiggled to the right. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know its right name&mdash;if
it has any&mdash;but the natives call it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rio Del Muerte,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;The
River of Death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lew Kirby told you that, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s where he said I&rsquo;d find you. Somewhere
up the Rio Del Muerte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nara showed a pleased smile at this new token of
a bond between his former partner, Lew Kirby, and
Mr. Brewster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your trail will bring you to the Rio Del Muerte,&rdquo;
resumed Nara, &ldquo;but you will strike it many miles
above the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many miles above?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know. I have never gone by that route.
But the native bearers will know when they reach the
Rio Del Muerte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you follow it downstream until you meet
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will that be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Nara eyed Mr. Brewster in quick, birdlike fashion,
then decided to answer the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a split rock on the north bank,&rdquo; stated Nara,
&ldquo;They call it La Porta Del Diablo, or the Devil&rsquo;s
Gate. Come through the gateway and continue up the
ravine. It leads to El Dorado. I will meet you on the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Whitman and Jacome were coming from the
jungle with a crew of natives. Mr. Brewster spoke
quickly to Nara. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t show those shrunken heads
to these chaps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time old Joe kept his shrunken heads out of
sight. He and his two Wai Wais left to get their canoe,
and soon the Indians were paddling up the Rio Negro.
Joe Nara was waving from between two heaps of
packs and luggage.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster, meanwhile, had opened a box of
trinkets that he was distributing to create good will.
Eagerly, the natives accepted colored marbles, bright
shiny beads, little round mirrors, and other geegaws.
Biff saw Kamuka looking longingly at the eye-catching
gifts and mentioned it to his father, who promptly
gave some to the Indian boy.</p>
<p>Kamuka took some marbles and a mirror, but with
a slight show of reluctance. It was evident that he
valued things that were useful as well as showy.
Among the assortment, Biff found a small microscope.
He handed it to Kamuka with the comment:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something you will really like. This glass
makes little things look big.&rdquo; Biff held the lens above
an ant that was crawling along a dried palm leaf.
&ldquo;Here, see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka tried the simple microscope and smiled
when he saw that the insect appeared larger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;but I like mirror better,
because I can flash sunlight, like you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can use this glass with the sun, too,&rdquo; Biff said.
&ldquo;Hold it close to the leaf&mdash;that&rsquo;s right&mdash;now tilt it so
the sun shines through. Keep it that way and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka didn&rsquo;t have to wait long. The sun&rsquo;s focused
rays soon burned a hole in the leaf. Kamuka
tried another leaf with the same result. He turned to
Biff and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a lot of dry leaves, all in one pile, you can
start big fire with this&mdash;maybe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You catch on fast, Kamuka,&rdquo; complimented Biff.
&ldquo;Yes, a burning glass is often used to start a fire. It&rsquo;s
a right handy thing to have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka pocketed the microscope along with the
mirror and his other new possessions. In a serious tone,
he said, &ldquo;Time to get ready for trail now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff noted that Jacome was assigning the new bearers
to their packs and other equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, recess is over,&rdquo; acknowledged Biff. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get
our packs and join the parade.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The boys found, much to their relish, that they
were not needed as pack carriers. Mr. Whitman had
hired a few spare bearers at the village, and since this
new crew was fresh, with less than a half day&rsquo;s journey
before sunset, Mr. Brewster had decided to let
them take the full load.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two can go ahead,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster told Biff
and Kamuka. &ldquo;The villagers tell me that the trail is
well marked, so you won&rsquo;t miss it. But there may be
short stretches that need clearing before we come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It worked out as Mr. Brewster anticipated. At a
few spots, Biff and Kamuka encountered tangled undergrowth
which they managed to hack away with
their machetes, by the time the safari caught up with
them. As they were starting ahead again, Mr. Brewster
noted the position of the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow about an hour,&rdquo; he told the boys. &ldquo;Then
start looking for a good campsite. You can wait there
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff enjoyed the carefree, late-afternoon hike
through the vast green vault of the jungle, particularly
with Kamuka, who was quick to spot all forms of
wild life. Once, Kamuka pointed to a curious creature
with a huge shell that was moving across the trail.
Biff looked just in time to see it roll up into a solid
ball and play dead.</p>
<p>The thing was an armadillo, the most heavily armored
denizen of the jungle. Again, Kamuka called a
halt while they watched what looked like a Teddy
bear with white legs attached to a gray, black-banded
body. It was attacking a huge anthill, darting a long,
thin tongue from its snouted muzzle. The creature
was a giant anteater, feeding on its favorite prey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p004.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="701" />
<p class="caption"><i>Up popped a group of tawny natives</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Kamuka was quick as well as accurate with the
machete. Once, while slashing at a low bush, he
changed the direction of his swing. The long blade
whisked within inches of Biff&rsquo;s shin. As Biff sprang
back, he saw the actual target of Kamuka&rsquo;s quick
aim.</p>
<p>The machete had clipped the head from a snake
which had been rearing to strike at Biff&rsquo;s leg. Pale
yellow in color, with brown, diamond-shaped spots,
it somewhat resembled a rattler, except that it had
sounded no loud warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mapepire</i>,&rdquo; defined Kamuka. &ldquo;Very bad. Worse
poison than <i>curare</i>, like Macu use on arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff decided that the snake was a species of bushmaster,
one of the most deadly of tropical reptiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neat work, Kamuka,&rdquo; Biff exclaimed gratefully.
&ldquo;You sure were johnny-on-the-spot that time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny-on-the-spot,&rdquo; repeated Kamuka. &ldquo;What
does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody who is around when you need them
most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A troop of red howler monkeys were hopping
from one high tree to another, sometimes hanging on
to branches only by their tails. The boys were watching
those acrobatics, when a sudden stir occurred in
the brush around them.</p>
<p>Up from the bushes popped a group of tawny natives,
wearing odd-shaped aprons made of hides decorated
with bright feathers and large, dull beads.
Their faces and bodies were streaked with scarlet dye
that looked like war paint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Some were holding bows, with arrows on drawn
strings. Others were raising long blowguns to their
lips. All were aimed toward a central target; the spot
where Biff and Kamuka stood.</p>
<p>Biff felt himself sink inwardly as he heard Kamuka
gasp the word: &ldquo;Macu!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />A Sudden Surprise</h2>
<p>Slowly, the Macu warriors closed in on the two
boys. The sharp eyes that glared from painted faces
were on the watch for even the slightest move.</p>
<p>Kamuka muttered to Biff, &ldquo;Drop machete. Right
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Kamuka let his machete fall, Biff did the same.
The inner circle of Macus dropped their own weapons
and sprang forward upon the boys.</p>
<p>The two were captured without a struggle. The
Macus brought out rawhide bowstrings and tied the
wrists of the prisoners behind them. They also tied
their ankles together, but in hobble fashion, far
enough apart so that they could still take short steps.</p>
<p>Two of their captors picked up the machetes. Another
snatched Biff&rsquo;s wrist watch and tugged it loose.
Next, they were finding prizes in the pockets of the
prisoners: Biff&rsquo;s scout knife and his father&rsquo;s metal mirror;
the marbles and the little mirror that Kamuka
had been given earlier in the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Kamuka seemed indifferent to all that happened. He
braced his feet so that the Macus had trouble pushing
him around. Biff copied that procedure and found
that it helped. Their captors were in a hurry because
all the while, the cries of the howler monkeys were
becoming louder. Above the din, Kamuka said
calmly, &ldquo;If they hear this back at the safari, they will
know that we are having trouble. They will come to
help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will they know what is happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see why. Soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaping monkeys formed dark red streaks against
the deep green of the jungle foliage. A few Macus
were guarding Biff and Kamuka. The rest spread out
through the brush, where they squatted as they had
originally. Gradually, the commotion lessened up in
the treetops. Then, as the monkeys returned to normal,
the Macus bobbed up again.</p>
<p>Now, their bows and blowguns were pointed upward.
The air was suddenly filled with arrows and
darts that found their marks high above. Monkeys began
tumbling from the trees, while the rest scattered,
howling louder than before. From the distance came
answering chatter, like an alarm spreading through
the jungle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Macu come across river to hunt monkeys,&rdquo;
Kamuka told Biff. &ldquo;We heard monkeys talk. I should
have known Macu were here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The Macus gathered up the dead monkeys and
marched Biff and Kamuka back along the trail. New
howls were coming from far off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; undertoned Kamuka. &ldquo;Maybe safari
will hear and come fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or go the other way faster,&rdquo; put in Biff. &ldquo;Those
villagers are scared by the very thought of meeting
up with Macus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your father will come, with Mr. Whitman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope they won&rsquo;t fall into the same trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will not fall into trap. They will have Jacome
with them. He will be on watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s hopes rose at Kamuka&rsquo;s words, only to fall
again as their Macu captors turned suddenly from the
trail. Instead of trampling the side path, the Macus
moved stealthily in single file, pushing the captured
boys into the line ahead of them. They spread the
jungle plants as they moved through them, then let
them fall back into place, leaving no trace of their
route.</p>
<p>Literally, the entire party was swallowed by the
jungle. Biff groaned loud enough for Kamuka to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine chance we have now!&rdquo; Biff said. &ldquo;They will
never find us, unless the natives know where the
Macu village is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macu never make village,&rdquo; replied Kamuka. &ldquo;All
they do is tear down huts that belong to other people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The procession was moving straight westward toward
the setting sun. That, at least, made sense to
Biff, for it proved that the Macus had come from
across the Rio Negro, as they usually did. Evidently
they had found the fishing poor, so had gone on a
monkey hunt instead.</p>
<p>Soon, the procession reached the Macu camp. This
was a small natural clearing where the Macus had
chopped down a few palm trees. Women of the tribe
were sewing palm leaves together to form roofs for
crude shelters around a central fire.</p>
<p>While the hunters skinned monkeys for the evening
meal, other tribesmen gathered around Biff and Kamuka,
prodding them as if they were curiosities. Their
hands were finally released and they were allowed to
eat. Biff was glad that they were fed left-over fish
instead of monkey meat.</p>
<p>Then they were marched to two small trees. Biff&rsquo;s
wrists were tied behind him around a tree, and he
was allowed to slide down to a sitting position. Kamuka
was tied in the same fashion to another tree only
a few feet away. Liana ropes were used instead of
thongs, but the knots were very tight and solid.</p>
<p>Other Macus tied their ankles in the same manner,
so that escape would be difficult, if not impossible.
As the Macus moved away and gathered around the
slowly dying fire, Biff saw their ruddy faces and
spoke to Kamuka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sure look bloodthirsty, with their faces all
done up in war paint.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is not for war,&rdquo; said Kamuka. &ldquo;It is for hunger.
They will wear the paint all night, for luck in
catching monkeys tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and Kamuka were not too uncomfortable that
night. They slept fitfully until dawn, when the
women brought them water but offered them no food.
When they were alone again, Biff asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about head-hunters now, Kamuka?
Will they let us grow up before they shrink
our heads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; returned Kamuka. &ldquo;Sometimes they take
prisoners for members of the tribe. But I do not want
to be Macu. I want to be johnny-on-the-spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on the spot all right. We both are. If I only
had something to cut these ropes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something Macu did not find. I have it in
back pocket where I can get it easy. Burning glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka&rsquo;s words roused Biff to an eager pitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get it, Kamuka!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Try to hold it
into the sunlight and turn it toward my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will burn your hands&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long, it won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll tell you when to move it
and which way to tilt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka soon had the little microscope tilted toward
the sun. Biff repressed a sudden &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; and
then said calmly, &ldquo;Just a little higher, Kamuka. Hold
it there a moment. No, a little more. Now, the other
way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smell rope burning!&rdquo; Kamuka said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it just as it is,&rdquo; urged Biff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Soon Biff, too, could smell the burning rope. A minute
later, he found that the bonds yielded when he
tried to pull his wrists apart. Finally the rope broke
completely, and with one hand free Biff was able to
take the microscope and work on Kamuka&rsquo;s bonds.</p>
<p>By now, most of the Macu hunters had left the
camp, and the few who remained were still asleep.
The boys worked on their ankle ropes, unnoticed, but
found them so tight that they had to take turns burning
them. Finally free, they realized that their biggest
problem lay ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t both make a run for it at once,&rdquo; whispered
Biff, &ldquo;or they might wake up and spot us. You
slide for the brush first, Kamuka. If they still see me,
they may not notice that you have gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t leave you here alone, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be leaving me. I&rsquo;ll give you time to
work around the clearing. Then if they see me start
to leave, you can raise a yell and draw them your
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Biff. We try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ruse worked better than they had hoped. Kamuka
gained the edge of the clearing with ease. Biff gave
him due time to get properly posted, then followed
the same route. They had chosen it well, for it was
not only the closest edge of the clearing; it was directly
toward the rising sun, which would tend to
dazzle anyone who looked that way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Once in the jungle, Biff kept close to the clearing as
he circled it, calling softly to Kamuka until they
finally met. Again, the sun proved helpful. They had
been headed toward it when they were brought here
as prisoners, late in the previous afternoon. So now,
they had only to move toward the morning sun to
reach the jungle trail.</p>
<p>It was slow going, as they had to be wary of
animals in the brush, yet all the while they felt the
urge to hurry in case their escape had been discovered
back at the Macu camp. At last, however, they came
upon the trail. Then came the question: Which direction
should they take?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The safari must have come as far as we did,&rdquo; declared
Biff, &ldquo;in fact probably a lot farther, as they
were supposed to keep on coming until they overtook
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when they didn&rsquo;t find us,&rdquo; said Kamuka, &ldquo;they
must have turned back to look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; decided Biff. &ldquo;They could
have figured, too, that we missed the trail somewhere
along the line. I&rsquo;ll tell you what. Let&rsquo;s go back along
the trail a couple of miles anyway. If we don&rsquo;t meet
them, we&rsquo;ll know they are up ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the time,&rdquo; added Kamuka, &ldquo;we keep good
sharp look for Macu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That final point was so important that both Biff
and Kamuka kept paying more attention to the bordering
jungle than to the trail itself. Every sound,
from a bird call to a monkey howl might mean that
Macu hunters were about. So could the slightest stir
among the jungle flowers and the banks of surrounding
plants, where at any moment, painted faces topped
with wavy hair might come popping into sight as
they had the afternoon before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>But there wasn&rsquo;t a trace of motion in all that sultry
setting until the boys reached a place where the trail
took a short, sharp turn around the slanted trunk of
a fallen ceiba tree. Biff, in the lead, gave a quick glad
cry as he saw native bearers coming toward them,
bowed under the weight of the packs they carried.</p>
<p>At the head of the column strode a white-clad
man wearing a tropical helmet. At sight of him, Biff
turned and called to Kamuka:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mr. Whitman coming with the whole safari!
We&rsquo;re safe now, Kamuka! Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, Biff dashed forward, only to be caught
by the shoulders and spun full about, his arm twisted
in back of him. Biff&rsquo;s captor shoved him straight toward
the leader of the safari, and the boy saw for the
first time that the man in white wasn&rsquo;t Mr. Whitman.</p>
<p>Looking down from beneath the pith helmet was
the ever-smiling face of Nicholas Serbot, tinted an
unearthly green in the subdued glow of the jungle.
Over Biff&rsquo;s shoulder leered the face of his captor,
Big Pepito!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />Between Two Fires</h2>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s first concern was for Kamuka. He managed to
dart a quick look along the trail hoping to shout a
warning to his companion. Then, Biff caught himself,
fearful that such a call would turn attention in Kamuka&rsquo;s
direction.</p>
<p>The warning wasn&rsquo;t needed. Kamuka had witnessed
Biff&rsquo;s rapid capture and had taken action on his own.
With uncanny instinct, Kamuka had found an opening
in the seemingly solid wall of jungle and had already
dived from sight.</p>
<p>One man, however, had seen the green mass close
behind Kamuka&rsquo;s quick-moving form. That man was
Urubu. He raised his rifle and fired into the thick foliage,
three times in quick succession.</p>
<p>As Urubu paused, Biff appealed frantically to Serbot:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him shoot again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Serbot ordered Urubu to lower his rifle, which the
guide did. At the same time, Urubu grinned, for he
had seen no ripple in the jungle leaves beyond the spot
where he had first aimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; purred Serbot, &ldquo;Urubu is trying to shoot
an anaconda, the way he did the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or some other jungle creature,&rdquo; added Pepito,
over Biff&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;like those that we heard run
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff guessed that they were trying to draw out facts
from him, to learn if he and Kamuka had followed
Luiz and listened in on the discussion that had shaped
the later events. As Biff tightened his lips, determined
not to answer, Urubu became impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe,&rdquo; put in the leering guide, &ldquo;I just now
try to kill some person, the way Luiz was chased and
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to Luiz was his own fault,&rdquo; Biff
argued hotly. &ldquo;He tried to kill my father first, with
a knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bearers did not tell us that,&rdquo; stated Serbot
smoothly. &ldquo;We met them on their way back to Santa
Isabel, and they told us that Whitman had fired at
Luiz, who ran into quicksand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where we tried to save him. Did they tell you
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they told us that. But not that Luiz had tried
to kill your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That happened before they even woke up. By
then, Luiz had started to run, so naturally Mr. Whitman
went after him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;The boy lies,&rdquo; snarled Urubu. &ldquo;The bearers did
not give you foolish talk like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They gave us other foolish talk,&rdquo; reminded Serbot.
&ldquo;They scared our crew by saying there were
Macus around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are Macus around!&rdquo; exclaimed Biff.
&ldquo;Their camp is only a few miles away from here. I
know, because the Macus had me tied up as a prisoner
all last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effect on Serbot&rsquo;s party was electric. Even before
Urubu could translate the words to the bearers,
they were dropping their packs, ready to take to
flight, for they recognized the name &ldquo;Macus&rdquo; when
Biff mentioned it.</p>
<p>But Serbot, raising his smooth tone to a surprisingly
strong pitch, spoke in a mixture of Portuguese and native
dialect that Biff managed to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you go?&rdquo; demanded Serbot. &ldquo;Do you
think you will be safe by running away like frightened
deer, while the Macus are looking for just such
prey? If there are Macus all around, as the boy says,
there is nothing for us to do but go on and be ready
for them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this while, Pepito had retained his grip on Biff,
but had been gradually relaxing the hold. Now, at
Serbot&rsquo;s order, he released Biff entirely, but still
kept a wary eye on him. Biff longed to dash into the
jungle and look for Kamuka, but again he managed
to restrain himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The chances were that Urubu&rsquo;s shots had missed
and that Kamuka was lying low in the motionless foliage.
To race after him and draw new gunfire would
be the worst thing that Biff could possibly do. So he
waited patiently until the safari started on.</p>
<p>Then Serbot took the lead, telling Biff to stay beside
him, while Pepito guarded one flank and Urubu
the other, all three carrying ready rifles. The bearers
stepped along close together, eager to get through the
Macu territory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a sharp watch,&rdquo; Serbot told Biff. &ldquo;The Macus
caught you yesterday. Don&rsquo;t let them trap you again
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Occasionally, Biff managed to look back, hoping
that Kamuka had come from cover and was stealing
along behind the safari. Soon Biff gave that up, realizing
that if Kamuka had decided to follow them, he
would be staying completely out of sight.</p>
<p>When they reached the spot where the Macus had
bobbed up the day before, Biff recognized it. He
turned to Serbot and said, &ldquo;This is where the head-hunters
were yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Serbot swung about and ordered the safari to halt.
As the bearers set down their packs, Biff studied their
faces and realized that some were members of the
group that Whitman had organized, the natives who
had started home when Joe Nara had exhibited the
shrunken heads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Their meeting with Serbot&rsquo;s safari must have scared
some of Serbot&rsquo;s crew into going back to Santa Isabel.
But Serbot or Urubu must have talked some of
Whitman&rsquo;s men into coming along as replacements.
Now Biff understood how Serbot had learned so
much about Luiz.</p>
<p>After a brief rest, Serbot asked Biff, &ldquo;Were there
many head-hunters here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Biff. &ldquo;A lot of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And which way did they take you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff pointed to the west. Smoothly, Serbot asked,
&ldquo;If there were so many, how did you manage to escape
today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because most of them had left before dawn to go
hunting,&rdquo; replied Biff. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I was afraid of
running into them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. We&rsquo;ll be on the watch for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Serbot ordered the safari forward. At the end of
another mile, they came to a side trail, which cut
sharply in the direction of the Rio Negro. After a
rapid discussion with Urubu, so thick with dialect
that Biff could not understand it, Serbot decided to
take the river route.</p>
<p>As they started along it, Serbot spoke to Biff, using
the smooth, easy tone that reminded Biff of their
first meeting in the airplane above the Amazon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Macus are hunting along the main trail,&rdquo; declared
Serbot, &ldquo;they will never bother to come this
way. That makes it all the safer for us. Anyone taking
the main trail would be gone, for certain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>That was passed along by Urubu to the bearers,
who not only were pleased, but quickened their pace,
hoping to get out of Macu territory all the faster. But
Biff&rsquo;s heart sank, for he was afraid there would be no
catching up with his own safari now.</p>
<p>Then Biff noted that Serbot was studying him steadily.
Evidently, the smiling man was anxious to learn
which way the other safari had gone, and was hoping
that Biff&rsquo;s change of manner would give the fact
away.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there came an interruption that gave
Biff a cause for real alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>From the treetops came a running chatter that
seemed to carry like a wave from somewhere off in
the jungle. Biff recognized the excited gabble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The howler monkeys!&rdquo; he told Serbot. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the way they acted after the Macus shot some of
them with arrows yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Serbot tried to gauge the direction of the sound,
then ordered the safari onward, faster. They followed
the rough, irregular trail until they reached a spot
where the chatter lessened and finally quieted altogether.
Serbot waved for the bearers to set down
their packs.</p>
<p>The order came just in time. The bearers themselves
pointed to heads and shoulders that bobbed
from behind trees and bushes. Terrified, the bearers
shouted, &ldquo;Macu!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Serbot dived behind a pack, to use it as a shelter.
Pepito and Urubu did the same, expecting Biff to join
them with the huddling bearers, for spears, arrows,
and darts were now skimming toward them. Instead,
Biff acted upon sudden impulse and raced along the
jungle trail. He heard guns blast in back of him, but
knew Serbot and the others were too busy shooting
at the attacking head-hunters to worry about him.</p>
<p>Biff passed a turn in the trail and knew then that he
was safe from gunfire, but he had his eye on an
opening in the jungle another hundred feet ahead.
There, Biff was sure that he could duck from sight the
way Kamuka had. But Biff was becoming too hopeful
too soon.</p>
<p>Less than halfway to the spot, Biff halted in his
tracks as the foliage parted and a painted Macu warrior
loomed in sight. Armed with bow and arrow, the
deadly marksman was already taking aim at Biff with
his bowstring fully drawn.</p>
<p>Another moment, and the poison-tipped arrow
would be in flight, allowing Biff no chance of escape
at such close range!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />The River of Death</h2>
<p>The twang of the head-hunter&rsquo;s bowstring was
drowned by an explosive burst from farther up the
trail. With it, the Macu marksman gave an upward,
sideward jolt at the very instant the arrow was leaving
his bow.</p>
<p>The feathered missile zimmed high and wide by a
matter of scant inches, for Biff could hear it whirr
past his ear and stop with a sharp thud in a tree trunk
just behind him.</p>
<p>A piercing yell seemed to echo the timely gunshot.
The Macu had dropped his bow and was gripping his
left arm with his right hand as he dived off into the
jungle. The bullet had jolted the bow from the Macu&rsquo;s
grasp, sending the arrow wide.</p>
<p>Now, looking up the trail, Biff saw his father
hurrying in his direction, rifle in hand. Biff started to
meet him, shouting, &ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; only to have Mr. Brewster
wave him back. Next, Biff saw his father take a
quick shot at another Macu huntsman who had
popped up in the brush, only to drop from sight again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Now, from the other side of the trail, a brown
head and arm poked from among a mass of blossoms
that sprouted from the thin bark of a fallen tree
trunk. Biff heard the familiar call: &ldquo;Biff, come this
way! Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Kamuka. Biff vaulted the log and took shelter
behind it, but tried to shake off Kamuka&rsquo;s restraining
hand as he saw his father come along the
trail with Mr. Whitman and Jacome. All three were
taking long-range shots at distant Macus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to warn Dad,&rdquo; Biff explained. &ldquo;Serbot&rsquo;s
party is just around the bend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows,&rdquo; assured Kamuka. &ldquo;We were coming
back when we heard their guns. So we hurry
fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming back along this trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. When they couldn&rsquo;t find us on the
main trail, they think maybe we take this one. So today,
they take it to look for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you sneaked ahead of Serbot&rsquo;s party after
you ducked from sight. But how did you know to
take this side trail when you reached it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacome leave special message that I understand.
Twist of grass and broken jungle branch are as good
as mirror signal, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster and his fellow-marksmen had rifles
with a longer range than the Macu weapons. Also,
they were able to shift positions along the trail, preventing
the Macus from picking a point of attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Serbot&rsquo;s party, on the contrary, had first let the
Macus close in on them. Then, in solidly entrenching
themselves, they had lost all chance of mobility. Soon
they would have been surrounded if Mr. Brewster
and his companions hadn&rsquo;t come along to scatter the
foe. Kamuka called Biff&rsquo;s attention to that fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macu run like scared deer,&rdquo; said Kamuka. &ldquo;But
now your father is telling Mr. Whitman and Jacome
to stop shooting. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Dad wants to keep the Macus around as a
threat,&rdquo; returned Biff grimly, &ldquo;until he sees what Serbot
intends to do. Urubu might take a pot shot at
anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka gave a knowing nod. &ldquo;You tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you saw it was Urubu who fired after
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Biff. I look long enough to see him aim. I
tell Mr. Brewster all that happened, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently, Mr. Brewster had profited by Kamuka&rsquo;s
report. He had reached the bend where he was in
direct sight of Serbot&rsquo;s entrenched party, but he
was motioning for Whitman and Jacome to stay behind
him.</p>
<p>Serbot looked up from behind a pack, then gave a
wary glance in the direction the Macus had gone. A
few arrows came whizzing from high among the
tree boughs, but they landed wide. They were sufficient,
however, to shape Serbot&rsquo;s next decision.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Serbot ordered Pepito and Urubu to resume their
shooting after the Macus. At the same time, Serbot
clambered over the packs and came along the path to
meet Mr. Brewster, who in his turn ordered Mr.
Whitman and Jacome to renew their fire on the distant
head-hunters. Rifles barked in unison.</p>
<p>Biff and Kamuka joined their party in time to catch
a last glimpse of the routed head-hunters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t stop until they reach their camp,&rdquo;
declared Biff, &ldquo;and maybe they&rsquo;ll still keep on going
from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until they reach the Rio Negro,&rdquo; added Kamuka,
&ldquo;and maybe they swim it quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s meeting with Serbot resulted in an
immediate, though guarded truce. Mr. Whitman and
Jacome moved up to back Mr. Brewster, while
Serbot was beckoning for Pepito and Urubu to come
and join him. The boys stayed in the background as
did Serbot&rsquo;s bearers, none of whom had been injured
in the brief fray.</p>
<p>How many head-hunters might be lying dead in the
brush or limping away wounded, there was no telling,
but the battle had been won rapidly and effectively.
Serbot seemed duly appreciative as he purred:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We owe you much, <i>amigo</i>. You have helped us.
Perhaps there is some way we can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster said curtly. &ldquo;Now
that we have driven off the Macus, we can go our
separate ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you go anywhere? You have no
bearers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are waiting farther up the main trail, with
our equipment. We left them while we came back to
look for the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Serbot promptly raised a new line of inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are surprised to see me here,&rdquo; he suggested,
&ldquo;So far from Manaus, where we last met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I be surprised?&rdquo; returned Mr. Brewster.
&ldquo;We are both looking for <i>balata</i>, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not looking for rubber,&rdquo; Serbot declared. &ldquo;I
am looking for a man named Joe Nara, who claims
to have a gold mine somewhere near the headwaters
of the Rio Negro. He came down to Manaus in a fast
boat shortly before you left your hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you I had left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The manager at the Hotel Jacares. He also said
that your room appeared to have been robbed. The
next day your jeep was found near an empty boathouse.
I learned that Senhor Whitman had started
from there on a rubber exploration trip upriver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you thought I had joined him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Senhor. So I came by plane to find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff realized that Serbot&rsquo;s plane must have been one
of those that had passed over Nara&rsquo;s cruiser on the
trip up the Rio Negro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I hired Urubu as a guide,&rdquo; continued Serbot,
&ldquo;I learned that you had arrived on Nara&rsquo;s cruiser. So
I assumed that you planned to meet Nara later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you bribed Luiz to kill me, to make sure of
meeting Nara first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, <i>Senhor</i>. I only wanted Luiz to delay your
safari, as Pepito and Urubu will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Serbot gestured to the pair, and Pepito smiled
broadly while Urubu showed his usual ugly grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to talk to Nara,&rdquo; continued Serbot
earnestly, &ldquo;because I had heard that he was willing to
sell his gold mine to the highest bidder. That is, if
he really has a gold mine. Perhaps you could tell me
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; returned Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;As
you say, I am only interested in rubber. And it&rsquo;s time
that I was starting off to look for some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that parting, Mr. Brewster motioned his companions
back toward the main trail. They had only
gone a dozen paces, when Mr. Brewster undertoned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take turns glancing back to see what that crowd
is doing. I don&rsquo;t trust any of them, particularly
Urubu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff took the first look and reported that Urubu,
like Serbot and Pepito, was leaning on his gun while
the trio apparently discussed what to do next. Soon
Kamuka reported the same thing. Then Mr. Whitman
looked back and announced that the group was now
out of sight.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster called for a quicker pace, and when
they reached the main trail, they moved even faster&mdash;so
fast in fact, that Biff and Kamuka had to jog along
to keep up with the three men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came back to look for you at dawn,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s
father told the boys, &ldquo;so our bearers will be packed
and waiting for us when we reach our last night&rsquo;s
campsite. If Serbot pushes his crew to overtake us,
they will be worn out, while we&rsquo;ll be starting fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Mr. Whitman was feeling the heat, for he removed
his white helmet to mop his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Serbot will try to overtake
Nara by going up the bank of the Rio Negro. That
makes all this hurry useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we still must keep ahead of Serbot,&rdquo; Mr.
Brewster insisted. &ldquo;If Serbot has guessed where Nara
is going, he will move up the Rio Del Muerte while
we are coming down it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bearers were waiting when they reached the
campsite, and fell promptly into line. There was little
difficulty in spurring them on. The mere mention
that the Macus were behind them was enough. During
the next few days, the bearers toiled steadily along
the inland trail. Apparently, there was nothing that
they feared more than the Macus.</p>
<p>Nothing, at least, until the safari reached a deep but
narrow stream that the bearers promptly identified as
Rio Del Muerte. Then they broke into a babble of
Indian talk that only Jacome was able to translate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say they leave us here,&rdquo; declared Jacome.
&ldquo;It is death, they say, to go down this river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster studied the narrow trail that flanked
the riverbank and dwindled off into the thick green
of the jungle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them that if they go back the way they came,
they may meet the Macus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Jacome translated Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s comment. The
bearers chattered back excitedly, and Jacome announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say they would rather meet Macu than stay
near Rio Del Muerte. They say they go home now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Jacome spoke, the bearers picked up their
few belongings and started on their homeward trek.
Biff and Kamuka noted that they did not even stop to
fill their water bags from the stream that they seemed
to dread so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it, Kamuka?&rdquo; Biff asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; Kamuka replied. &ldquo;I cannot even
understand the things they say to Jacome, except that
they are afraid to go downriver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the expedition was far from being
stranded. The pack bags that the native bearers had
abandoned contained three rubber boats, complete
with aluminum seats and paddles. Biff and Kamuka
helped pump them full of air, so that they took on a
squatty, roundish shape.</p>
<p>Then, after a survey of the rubber flotilla, Mr.
Brewster decided to take Biff and Kamuka with him
in one boat, while Mr. Whitman and Jacome manned
the second, each carrying whatever equipment it
could bear. The third boat was converted into a raft
and loaded with all the remaining packs. Biff&rsquo;s father
took it in tow, letting Hal Whitman pace the trip
downstream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>To Biff, this was a fine change after the long,
sweaty hours on the trail when he and Kamuka had
helped relieve the bearers. They were floating
through a maze of jungle green that at times actually
arched into a tunnel above them.</p>
<p>Though heavily loaded, the boats moved easily,
more swiftly as the jungle banks narrowed and the
river itself deepened. Whitman was waving back
cheerily as they skimmed off the mileage. Suddenly
they saw him rise and wag his paddle frantically as he
shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay back&mdash;stay back&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were drowned by a mighty roar as they
turned the bend and saw what Whitman had already
viewed. No wonder the natives called this the Rio
Del Muerte, the River of Death! Just ahead, a curved
crest of foam showed where the stream took a sudden
drop in the form of a mammoth waterfall&mdash;a sheer
plunge to doom on the rocks a hundred feet below!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />The Devil&rsquo;s Gateway</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Paddle hard on the right, boys&mdash;with all your
might!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster shouted the order above the river&rsquo;s
tumult, and all three bent to the task. They brought
their boat broadside to the approaching brink and
drove it toward the left bank of the stream, which
here was scarcely a hundred feet wide.</p>
<p>It was a gruelling race against death. There was no
escaping the powerful current that seemed to draw
them with a suction pull. Yet the jungle bank was
coming closer with every stroke.</p>
<p>They were almost there now, but Biff, in the bow,
had no chance to catch the first projecting tree, as the
boat was swept past it. He worked madly with the
paddle instead, for here the bank was eaten away by
the current, and there was nothing to grab.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>It seemed certain now that the boat would be carried
over the falls, when suddenly it began to swirl
about, and another few strokes brought them into the
last big clump of overhanging brush.</p>
<p>Biff and Kamuka managed to grab hold and cling
there, while Mr. Brewster worked the boat into the
bank itself. Then new disaster loomed in the shape of
the pack boat which had been following them on
its towline. As the other boat spun past, its line went
taut before Mr. Brewster could cut it.</p>
<p>Biff&rsquo;s shoulders seemed to wrench half from their
sockets, and he felt the bush pull loose from the soil.
Then the tug ended as the other boat came full about,
giving them a soft thump. Churned into this new
position, it bulked in between the bank and their
own craft, almost wedging them loose and out into
the stream.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster made a quick leap across the baggage
and up on to the high bank, carrying the slack line
which he hitched over a tree bough. That secured
both boats, while the boys clambered ashore.</p>
<p>In cutting away the bank, the current had created
an eddy which accounted for the final swirl that had
carried both boats to safety. Yet only a dozen feet
away, the tangled jungle growth actually quivered on
the fringe of the falls that dropped in one huge deluge
into the dizzy depths below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>It was from there that they first looked for Whitman&rsquo;s
boat, expecting to see it bobbing somewhere in
the rocky gorge a hundred feet below. The rising mist
obscured the bottom of the falls where the terrific
torrent would by now have battered the bodies of
Mr. Whitman and Jacome into a pulp.</p>
<p>Or so they thought, until Mr. Brewster stepped
closer to the overhanging bushes and gained a full
view of the crescent-shaped brink. He beckoned to
the boys and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caught between two low rocks, Whitman&rsquo;s boat
was jammed on the brink, its two occupants still alive,
temporarily at least. Heavily loaded, wide of beam
and flexible because of its inflated sides, the rubber
boat had snagged where almost any other craft would
have cracked up and gone over the crest.</p>
<p>Other low rocks jutted at close intervals along the
foamy brim. Biff noticed them when he saw Mr.
Whitman rise in the boat to point them out to Jacome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those rocks are like steppingstones, Dad!&rdquo; exclaimed
Biff. &ldquo;If we throw a line to them, maybe we
can haul them ashore&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>An interruption came as the boat wabbled on its
precarious perch, due to Mr. Whitman&rsquo;s shift of
weight. It settled back again, as Whitman plopped
down into the stem. From the shore, Biff&rsquo;s father gestured
for Whitman to stay down and received a nod
in reply. Turning to Biff, Mr. Brewster declared:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throwing them a line won&rsquo;t help. If they missed
their footing, they would be swept away in spite of it.
We&rsquo;ll have to carry it across to the other bank and
moor it there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>From the pack boat, Mr. Brewster produced a coil
of thin, strong rope which he estimated as more than
long enough to bridge the stream and return. He
looped the center around a tree trunk and gave the
ends to Kamuka, motioning him into the empty boat.
Then, with Biff helping, Mr. Brewster kept working
his way up along the bank, pulling the boat from the
shore, while Kamuka nimbly grabbed at passing
branches.</p>
<p>After they were a safe distance upstream, Mr.
Brewster brought Biff into the boat with him and told
the boys:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paddle hard on the left, this time. Try to swing
the boat upstream&mdash;and don&rsquo;t stop, not for one instant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, they were in the swirl of the swift-flowing
current where Biff, paddling bow, found it impossible
to bring the boat about, even with Kamuka working
valiantly to help him. But Mr. Brewster had allowed
for that. Their efforts, plus his own, brought them
to the far bank, still well above the falls.</p>
<p>There, the boys warped the boat downstream while
Biff&rsquo;s father hauled in the floating rope. Picking a
landing spot, they carried one end of the rope about a
tree, where they drew it taut and tied it to the other
end. The rope now followed the slight curve of the
cataract&rsquo;s brim from the opposite bank as far as Whitman&rsquo;s
stranded boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Mr. Brewster then took a loop of rope around a
paddle and began to twist it, winch fashion. He let
the boys take over, one at each end of the paddle,
while he waved to the boat and pointed to the water.
Whitman and Jacome understood the plan at once and
caught on to the rope as it emerged.</p>
<p>Rapidly, the boys turned the paddle, tightening the
rope until it looked like a suspension cable, except for
its outward curve. Mr. Whitman and Jacome, rising
gradually from the boat, gripped the center of the
double line.</p>
<p>Jacome took to the steppingstones first, moving in
limber, catlike fashion as he left the boat. Mr. Whitman,
who had settled low to offset the loss in weight,
watched every move, still clutching the center of the
rope, which also helped to steady the boat.</p>
<p>Hand over hand, Jacome followed the rope, swinging
from one projecting rock to the next, or actually
leaping a space where the water gushed through. It
became easier as Jacome neared the bank where the
pack boat was moored. There, Jacome swung on the
shore and waved for Whitman to follow.</p>
<p>As before, Whitman rose too rapidly. This time, the
boat skidded out from under him; as it did, he hopped
to the nearest rock and balanced there by clinging to
the rope. Biff saw the boat slide over the falls, tumbling
from sight with the light luggage it contained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Breathlessly, Biff watched Hal Whitman swing to
the next broad stone, where he swayed dangerously
while Mr. Brewster and Jacome, tightening their ends
of the rope, helped to steady him. What had been
child&rsquo;s play for Jacome would have meant disaster
for Whitman, without that timely aid.</p>
<p>The last leap, that looked the easiest, was the most
dangerous of all. Where Jacome had swung himself
clear up on the bank, Whitman dropped short, but
not into the sweeping current that fringed the shore.
Jacome had wisely edged the pack boat into the gap.
Whitman landed on the luggage, and Jacome pulled
him up to the bank above.</p>
<p>During the next few hours, the party worked its
way down the steep walls that flanked the waterfall.
This might have been impossible, except for the holds
afforded by the heavy jungle growth. The boats were
deflated and lowered by ropes. Then, when Biff and
Kamuka reached the gorge, they found a shallow
stretch where they waded and swam the river, to receive
the luggage from the pack boat that Mr. Whitman
and Jacome lowered from their side.</p>
<p>Farther downstream, the boys found Whitman&rsquo;s
boat, still intact, along with its baggage, which
Jacome had tied inside the rubber craft before abandoning
it. Biff and Kamuka hauled it ashore and
spread the contents of the bags so they could dry.</p>
<p>That night, they camped within sound of the big
waterfall, and the muffled roar seemed almost musical,
now that its hazard had been passed. But Hal Whitman,
seated by the campfire, spoke bitterly about his
harrowing experience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;I blame Joe Nara for all this,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I believe
he is our real enemy, not Nicholas Serbot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you figure that, Hal?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Brewster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, Nara must have snooped a lot more than he
let on,&rdquo; argued Whitman, &ldquo;in order to learn about
that boathouse down in Manaus. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; conceded Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;Go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by checking on me,&rdquo; continued Whitman,
&ldquo;he found out about you. He learned that you were
staying at the Hotel Jacares. So he sent one of his
Indians to steal your map&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Hal,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Brewster with a smile.
&ldquo;How could he have known that I even had the
map?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knew Lew Kirby made a deal with somebody.
You were the logical man, or you wouldn&rsquo;t have gone
to all the trouble and expense of sending me up to
Santa Isabel to organize a safari.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if Nara knew I had the map, why would he
want to steal it? Lew Kirby was his partner. Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo; Mr. Whitman smiled grimly.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, so does Joe Nara, and that&rsquo;s probably
the one thing he&rsquo;d like most to forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he wouldn&rsquo;t be bound by any deal that Kirby
made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Without the map, you haven&rsquo;t any claim.
If Kirby signed over his share of the mine to you, you
would need the map to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;I still have part of it, Hal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; acknowledged Whitman, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll bet that
Joe Nara only let you keep it because he decided it
wouldn&rsquo;t do you any good. Think it over, and you&rsquo;ll
see I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether or not Mr. Brewster thought it over during
the night, Biff certainly did. When they were
loading the boats at dawn to resume their trip downriver,
Biff asked his father:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that Mr. Whitman is right about Joe
Nara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be something in what he says,&rdquo; admitted
Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;Nara may have been keeping
something from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the day, they made speedy progress down
the river, hugging the bank at every bend to avoid
new waterfalls. But the trip proved smooth, which
only brought more grumbles from Whitman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nara sent us down this river to get rid of us,&rdquo; he
declared, as they paddled along. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t his fault
that the Rio Del Muerte failed to live up to its name.
As for that gateway where we&rsquo;re supposed to meet
him&mdash;El Porto Del Diablo&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think there is
such a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One hour later, those doubts were dispelled. As the
boats passed a bend, they came to an opening in the
jungle that looked like the dry bed of a stream that
had once joined the Rio Del Muerte. Then, amid the
thick green foliage, loomed the very rock that Nara
had mentioned, split like a huge gateway, a short
distance up the ravine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>They pulled the boats up on the low, sandy shore,
where Mr. Brewster decided to leave the packs and
other equipment, though not for long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nara said to come through the gateway,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and meet him somewhere up the ravine. If we
don&rsquo;t see him soon, we can come back and bring the
luggage in relays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trail narrowed at the end of half a mile and
veered sharply beneath a high, bulging cliff that
slanted back like a gigantic brow, cutting off the sunlight.
Mr. Brewster, well in advance, had reached the
turn in the ravine, when Jacome, bringing up the rear
of the procession, gave a loud, warning shout.</p>
<p>The rest looked up in time to see the tiny, squatty
figures of six men drop suddenly behind a row of
rocks that resembled the top edge of a castle tower.
But that impression was a brief one. As the group
stared from below, they saw the rocky summit topple
forward.</p>
<p>Those watchers on the cliff top had launched a
mass of bounding boulders that encountered bigger
chunks of granite and carried them along, with the
earth in which they were imbedded. An avalanche of
stone and dirt was gaining size as it roared down the
slope, threatening to block the narrow ravine and
bury every member of the party that had come into
its path!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />Fabulous El Dorado</h2>
<p>While the others stood rooted, staring upward, Biff
looked for his father, in the frantic hope of giving
him some last-moment warning. Up ahead, Mr.
Brewster was waving for them to join him. Biff
grabbed Whitman by the arm and tried to start him
forward, at the same time yelling to Kamuka and
Jacome:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our only chance! Maybe Dad can get us past
the turn in the ravine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all were starting forward before Biff finished
speaking, but their chance faded as the landslide&rsquo;s roar
increased. Spreading as it came over the cliff edge,
the first wave of dirt and stone was not only peppering
them; it was pouring into the side passage that
seemed their only refuge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Fortunately, none of them was hit by that first
spray of smaller stones. Whitman stumbled, but
Jacome overtook him and helped him regain his footing.
Then they had reached Mr. Brewster, who was
blocking them from the side passage where Biff
thought he wanted them to go.</p>
<p>Instead, Biff&rsquo;s father now was rushing them beneath
the overhanging cliff, where they huddled
against the rocky wall and turned to witness the havoc
that they had so narrowly escaped. From this hollow,
open space where Mr. Brewster had guided them,
they watched tons of dirt and stone drop down in a
solid curtain, only a dozen feet away, for the bulge of
the cliff above was comparatively slight.</p>
<p>Yet it jutted enough to send the tremendous landslide
cascading out beyond them, something on which
Mr. Brewster had counted when he made his quick
decision. But after the roar had finally subsided, Biff&rsquo;s
father disclaimed any special credit for the rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was close enough to see that this pocket offered
us our only chance,&rdquo; stated Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;As it was,
your own prompt response saved your lives. Otherwise,
you would now be under there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster gestured significantly to the mound
of earth and rock that had piled many feet above their
heads. Carefully, they worked their way up over it
and down a long slant to the main ravine, which
they followed back to the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>On the way, they looked up to the brow of the
great cliff, but saw no human figures there. They
noted though, that the landslide had turned the ravine
into a dead-end, with no trace of the narrow passage
that angled off to the right, the route that they
would have taken.</p>
<p>Back at the river, Biff&rsquo;s father sat on a pack and
commented rather ruefully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess this about ends our quest for El Dorado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; Whitman agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you all
along that Joe Nara was a phony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mentioned a few reasons why you thought
so,&rdquo; reminded Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;But they were hardly
sufficient, Hal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; retorted Whitman, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll add a few
clinchers. Nara said his men were Wai Wai Indians,
didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the Wai Wais come from clear over in British
Guiana, not from around here. And you remember
those shrunken heads he showed us? To prove
that Macus were around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those were Jivaro heads,&rdquo; declared Whitman,
&ldquo;from somewhere up the Amazon itself. Macus don&rsquo;t
shrink heads. All Nara wanted was to scare our bearers
back to Santa Isabel and chase us off into the jungle.
Right now, he&rsquo;s probably still down on the Rio
Negro, making a deal with Serbot, somewhere near
Piedra Del Cucuy, learning what the competition
has to offer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Whitman cut off, his mouth wide open as he looked
downstream. The others turned and saw a dugout
canoe approaching, with Joe Nara reclining comfortably
against the pack bags in its center, while Igo
and Ubi were paddling him up the Rio Del Muerte.
Old Joe was smiling as he stepped ashore, but he
became solemn when he saw the accusing eyes that
were fixed upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you&rsquo;re annoyed,&rdquo; apologized
Nara. &ldquo;I should have gotten here first&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect us to get here at all,&rdquo; Hal Whitman
broke in. &ldquo;Those directions of yours were a one-way
ticket over the falls on the Rio Del Muerte!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tried to come down the river by boat?&rdquo; Nara
paused and stared at the rubber boats. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
you had these with you. I said to follow the river,
that was all. Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; returned Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;You also
told us to go up through the gateway to the ravine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; interrupted Nara. &ldquo;I said for you
to come up through&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would be the difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if you came up through,&rdquo; explained Nara,
&ldquo;I would have been there to meet you. But if you
had gone up through ahead of me&rdquo;&mdash;he shook his
head&mdash;&ldquo;well, thank heavens, you didn&rsquo;t try it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the tribe that guards El Dorado would
have let loose a landslide if they saw strangers coming
their way. I was mighty glad to find you waiting
here. I knew you couldn&rsquo;t have gone up through
El Porto Del Diablo.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we did go up through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Joe Nara stared incredulously, Mr. Brewster described
all that had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that the ravine is blocked,&rdquo; he finished,
&ldquo;I suppose you can&rsquo;t take us to your fabulous El
Dorado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; returned Nara, with a quick
smile, &ldquo;I can take you to the mine by the short way.&rdquo;
He spoke to Igo and Ubi in dialect; then, as the Indians
went to the split rock, Nara announced, &ldquo;I told
them to summon some bearers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Igo and Ubi shouted up through the ravine, and
their calls seemed to echo back. Soon, squatty Indians
appeared from the Devil&rsquo;s Gateway until a dozen of
them had lined silently in front of Joe Nara. Kamuka
undertoned to Biff:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the men who pushed stones from hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figured that,&rdquo; said Biff. &ldquo;I wonder whether they
are surprised or sorry to see us still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are neither. They think Nara has made us
live again because we are his friends. They think Nara
is El Dorado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the furtive glances that the squatty Indians
gave toward the Brewster party, along with the way
they were awaiting Nara&rsquo;s bidding, Biff decided that
Kamuka had guessed right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>At Nara&rsquo;s command, the Indians did the unexpected.
They began replacing the packs and other
equipment in the rubber boats, while Nara suggested
that Mr. Brewster and his party get on board. Then
the Indians brought dugouts from the bushes, and
soon they were all paddling up the Rio Del Muerte,
with Nara&rsquo;s canoe in the lead.</p>
<p>The going was easy, for the current was sluggish
here. After about two miles, Igo and Ubi drove
Nara&rsquo;s dugout to a low bank where the jungle appeared
to be the thickest. With their paddles, they
raised a tangle of roots as they would a curtain, and
worked the boat through.</p>
<p>The others followed into a channel wide enough to
accommodate the rubber boats with ease. When the
foliage had been dropped behind the final canoe, Biff
looked back and saw that the mouth of this stream
was as completely hidden as before.</p>
<p>They emerged from the jungle near a towering
rock that looked like the one from which the Indians
had launched the landslide. They pulled up the boats
beside the stream and took to a steep trail that brought
them up behind the rock, past the far end of the
blocked ravine.</p>
<p>The trail climbed steadily, with more slopes rising
ahead. Beyond them were mountain peaks, some
looming blue and cloud-capped in the distance, overlooking
a vast, unexplored region. The chunky bearers
marched steadily onward, crossing logs over deep
ravines and following ledges hewn in the mountainsides.
Biff kept his eyes fixed on the backs of the
trudging Indians to avoid any dizziness from looking
below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are now in the Parima Mountains,&rdquo; Joe Nara
told them. &ldquo;This part of the range is in Venezuela.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; acknowledged Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;We
crossed the border from Brazil soon after we left
Piedra Del Cucuy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about these Indians of yours?&rdquo; Hal Whitman
put in. &ldquo;You say they are Wai Wais, Nara, but
that tribe lives over in Guiana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The main tribe does,&rdquo; returned Nara, &ldquo;but this
one group remained here to guard the sacred mountain,
where El Dorado is located. They believed that
Daipurui, the Spirit of Evil, would go on a rampage if
anyone found the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you get around that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figured out a trick,&rdquo; chuckled Nara, &ldquo;that made
them think I was El Dorado himself, the original
Golden Boy in person. So they took Lew Kirby and
me up to the mine, the same way they&rsquo;re going now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Single file, the Wai Wais were climbing steps cut
in a cliff, gripping liana vines as handrails to balance
the weight of their packs. As Biff began the climb,
the bearers looked like big, bulging beetles crawling
toward the skyline. One by one, they dropped from
sight as did the others in the party. Biff learned the
reason, when he reached a slanted ledge, like a niche
hacked in the cliff, and found the Wai Wais squatting
there.</p>
<p>Kamuka came just behind Biff, then others of the
party, and finally Joe Nara. Evidently, the Wai Wais
were awaiting him, for they began an odd chant that
included the words, &ldquo;El Dorado&mdash;El Dorado&mdash;&rdquo; and
continued as the shock-haired prospector strode past
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Nara paused where the ledge burrowed at a slant
into the cliff and beckoned for everyone to follow,
which they did. They entered a gloomy mine shaft,
so low that all members of the party had to stoop, except
the boys. The Wai Wai bearers, already bending
under their burdens, followed the route automatically
as though the passage had been cut to their size.</p>
<p>Daylight showed where the shaft opened into a
great cavern. There, the sun shone through cracks
and other openings in the ceiling. It glinted on chunky
rock walls that fairly burned with vivid golden yellow.</p>
<p>All the tales that Biff had ever heard of hidden
treasure had suddenly become real. This was a wonderland
of wealth, with glittering side shafts going
deeper into the mountain, promising new finds for
anyone who followed them. Kamuka, awed by the
yellow glitter, asked in breathless tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much you think this worth, Biff? A million
<i>cruzeiro</i>&mdash;maybe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot more, if it&rsquo;s gold ore,&rdquo; returned Biff. &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s worth practically nothing if it is simply yellow
quartz. A lot of that is found in Brazil, in places easier
to reach than this. What&rsquo;s just as bad, it may be fool&rsquo;s
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool gold? What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;A mineral called pyrite,&rdquo; exclaimed Biff, &ldquo;usually
iron, mixed with sulphur. It often fools people who
think that it is gold. But it is more the color of brass
than gold, and it leaves a green streak when you rub
it on something smooth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Biff picked up a chunk of yellow rock to examine
it, he caught a nod of approval from his father.
Biff had repeated facts that Mr. Brewster had told
him regarding metals. Now, Biff&rsquo;s father indicated a
stretch of rocky wall, where patches of yellow shone
from a background of milky white. He asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of this, Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like gold quartz for sure, Dad!&rdquo; exclaimed
Biff. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no chance of mistaking that. Or is
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case, there is no mistake.&rdquo; Mr. Brewster
was studying the milky quartz as he spoke. &ldquo;Undoubtedly,
this shaft was first mined centuries ago,
for it resembles old Indian mines that I have inspected.
But although it yielded gold years ago, I doubt that
its wealth has even begun to be tapped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about that,&rdquo; chuckled Joe Nara, who
was standing by. &ldquo;Look there&mdash;and there&mdash;and
there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nara had turned on a powerful flashlight, and with
each announcement, he pointed its beam down another
rough-hewn shaft that branched from the main
corridor. Each time, the glare was reflected with a
new burst of brilliance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gold of El Dorado!&rdquo; boasted Nara. &ldquo;A
mountain full of it and a lot more that cropped over,
as I&rsquo;ll show you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />Surrounded!</h2>
<p>From the great central room, Joe Nara led his companions
down through a maze of shafts and tunnels.
Each passage joined with another, and frequently the
links were steep steps worn smooth by the feet of
native miners, hundreds of years before.</p>
<p>At intervals, daylight showed through shafts that
had been driven down through the mountain to tap a
vein of gold. Always, the passages led finally into
new corridors that glittered with rich ore. At last, a
long straight tunnel brought the party out on the far
side of the mountain, hundreds of feet below the
starting level.</p>
<p>The slope was gradual here, featured by dirt gullies
leading down to a grassy valley, with the jungle beyond.
As they followed the bed of one dry stream,
Joe Nara pointed to the sparkle in its sands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve picked up some of these,&rdquo; he
chuckled, bringing some small gold nuggets from his
pocket and displaying them in his open hand. &ldquo;But
mostly I find them up some of the smaller stream
beds. The gold just kind of oozes out of the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the bottom of the slope was a shallow depression
that nestled like a bowl in the curve of the
mountainside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the lake was,&rdquo; declared Nara. &ldquo;The
lake where El Dorado used to take a dip and come
out all covered with gold. It&rsquo;s dried up, now, but
there&rsquo;s still plenty of gold down in those sands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster studied the lake bed carefully. Biff
saw his father look beyond, as though following a
sandy course that led down to the grassy area that
fringed the jungle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are probably right,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster told Nara.
&ldquo;The lake was artificially formed, and once the dam
was broken, the water found its way down into the
jungle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it joined a stream there,&rdquo; added Nara, &ldquo;as
I&rsquo;ll show you. Do you know why this all happened?&rdquo;
Tilting his head, he darted one of his birdlike glances
at Whitman, then back to Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
why. When the Indians found that the Spaniards and
the English were going after El Dorado as well as
after each other, they closed up shop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they did. Just closed up shop. They
busted the dam and got rid of the lake, so nobody
could find it. They covered over all the shafts so nobody
could find them either. They started rumors
about El Dorado being somewhere else, to send all
the explorers on a wild-goose chase. Then they kept
guard over the real El Dorado to scare away anybody
who stumbled on it by mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All quite logical,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;That is
the way the Indians would act.&rdquo; He turned to Whitman
and asked: &ldquo;You agree, don&rsquo;t you, Hal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; nodded Whitman. &ldquo;<i>Now</i> I know why
Nara showed us those shrunken heads. He did want
to scare our bearers so they would run back to Santa
Isabel. But it was because his Wai Wais would have
made trouble if we brought a strange tribe here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They made trouble enough as it was,&rdquo; declared
Nara, with a dry chuckle. Then, turning to Mr.
Brewster, he said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s left of that map
Lew Kirby gave you. Then we can figure what to do
next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster produced the torn corner from the
map. It showed the mine, the stream bed, the lake, and
the trail that continued into the jungle, where it
reached a river that was marked on the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The route is an easy one,&rdquo; stated Nara, &ldquo;as you
can see. But first, I want you to estimate the value of
the mine. Then pick out the ore you want, so we can
take it to the river. From there, we will go downstream
to the Casiquiare Canal and work our way
through to the Orinoco River.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>They camped that night beneath the trees that
fringed the jungle. The next day, Mr. Brewster returned
to the mine and studied it in detail. They
stayed in the same camp another night and on the
following day, the Indians brought down loads of ore
that Mr. Brewster had selected.</p>
<p>Those loads were carried several miles through the
jungle to the river that Nara had mentioned. Biff and
Kamuka helped make a new camp there. Then they
swam in the river while they waited for the Indians
to bring the packs. The water was very clear, and the
boys brought up handfuls of glittering sand from the
bottom. When Mr. Brewster saw it, he commented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fortune in gold to be dredged from this
stream. But we still have the problem of getting it
down the Orinoco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Nara had the answer to that problem. His Indians
showed up with a small flotilla of odd-looking
craft that resembled the <i>monterias</i> of the Amazon.
Nearly thirty feet long, each boat had an open cockpit
at the front with a thatched cupola at the stern,
serving as a sort of cabin.</p>
<p>Nara&rsquo;s boats were different, however, from the
more antiquated river craft. His boats were low in
the stern, so that the big steering paddle could be replaced
by a sizable outboard motor. Nara had such
motors and the gasoline to fuel them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every trip I made downriver,&rdquo; explained Nara,
&ldquo;either over the mountain and down the Rio Negro,
or down this stream to the Orinoco, I bought motors
and gasoline and brought them back here. I knew that
some day, Lew Kirby would talk some company into
a big deal for our mine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, I knew the first thing they would
ask would be if they could transport either the gold
or the ore once they mined it. My answer is, yes, and
I&rsquo;ve got the boats to prove it&mdash;and the motors, too.
I&rsquo;ve kept them for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judging by the appearance of the motors, that was
true. Some were twenty years old, but all proved
serviceable when attached to the loaded boats. The
four boats that formed the strange flotilla started out
at a slow but steady speed down the narrow jungle
river that marked the first stage of a long, adventurous
journey.</p>
<p>Each boat carried a crew of three. Biff and Kamuka
were in one boat with Mr. Brewster. Jacome and a
Wai Wai Indian were in another with Hal Whitman.
The third boat was Nara&rsquo;s, with Igo and Ubi as its
crew. The fourth, which served as a kitchen boat
and carried the food supply, was manned by three
Wai Wai tribesmen.</p>
<p>The packs, which included tents and other equipment,
were in the boats commanded by Mr. Brewster
and Mr. Whitman. The ore from the mine was mostly
in Nara&rsquo;s boat, which squatted lower in the water due
to its added weight. But it maintained the same speed
as the other craft for the simple but sufficient reason
that Nara had equipped it with the largest of his
old-model motors.</p>
<p>The containers of gasoline were distributed among
the boats, and all were careful not to waste any of
the precious fuel. At times, they used the oars or let
the current carry them. When they encountered channels
that were narrow or shallow, they poled the
boats through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>They were deep in the jungle when the river
opened into a fair-sized lake, where Nara pulled his
boat alongside of Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s, to check the map
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is one of the lagoons that connects with the
Casiquiare Canal,&rdquo; explained Nara. &ldquo;Actually, the
Casiquiare is an overflow from the Orinoco that
reaches the headwaters of the Rio Negro, forming a
link with the Amazon. But sometimes the canal backs
up and flows the wrong way. The important thing is
that it is always navigable, clear to the Orinoco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The job now was to work from one lagoon to another,
through channels that would have been shown
on the missing portion of Kirby&rsquo;s map. Nara knew the
route from memory, and fortunately he had been over
it several times. But he still had trouble picking his
way through a lot of lesser channels, and at times he
called upon Mr. Brewster to check the course by
compass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking a boat through a jungle,&rdquo; declared Nara,
&ldquo;is just like going for a hike in the woods. First thing
you know, you&rsquo;re traveling in a circle. Only you
don&rsquo;t ever really know it, because wherever you are,
it always looks the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more Biff thought that over, the more true it
seemed. But when he discussed it with Kamuka, the
Indian boy disputed the notion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;One place is not like another,&rdquo; declared Kamuka.
&ldquo;I look there, and I see so many trees. I remember
them like picture. You show me another place, the
picture is different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Biff, &ldquo;I suppose you can never
get lost in the jungle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get lost easy,&rdquo; returned Kamuka. &ldquo;Too easy.
Any place I do not know, I am lost&mdash;maybe. But I
never get lost in the same place where I was before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff decided to test that out in a simple but effective
way. As they chugged along, he made notes of certain
spots and told Kamuka to remember them on his own.
When they reached a similar place, Biff asked Kamuka
to tell him the difference. Always, Kamuka came
up with some slight variation that tallied with Biff&rsquo;s list.</p>
<p>When they swung into a small cove past a jutting
point with an odd overhanging tree, Biff was sure that
they had seen the place before. This time, Kamuka
couldn&rsquo;t come up with enough differences in the
scenery. Triumphantly, Biff was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Kamuka? This could be the same place
where we were an hour ago, or enough like it so you
can&rsquo;t tell the difference&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except,&rdquo; said Kamuka, &ldquo;that there was no smoke
in trees, no campfire with people around, no boats
coming out from shore&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff looked up in surprise. He saw more boats, a
whole batch of them, shooting out from opposite
points to block off any retreat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>More than a dozen in number, those boats were
filled with natives who shouted savage war cries as
they closed in on Nara&rsquo;s flotilla, forcing the heavier
boats toward the shore. There was no avoiding the
camp where warlike natives waited, armed with spears,
for now other canoes were darting out from hiding
places to complete the rapid roundup.</p>
<p>Rather than be boarded by the natives, Mr. Brewster
ordered the boats to the shore. There, he and Whitman
sprang out with loaded rifles. Biff and Kamuka followed,
bringing their machetes. Jacome joined them,
armed in the same fashion. Immediately, they were
surrounded by a dozen silent natives, who stood ready
with poised spears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; warned Jacome. &ldquo;Do not make move.
Big pot on fire is used to cook <i>curare</i>. Spear point
poison&mdash;maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between the circling natives, Biff saw the fire and
the pot that Jacome mentioned. It was a big, crude
kettle, steaming over the log flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re just cooking <i>curare</i>,&rdquo; Biff whispered
to Kamuka. &ldquo;I thought maybe they were boiling
some special stuff to shrink our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they do just that,&rdquo; returned Kamuka solemnly.
&ldquo;I do not like this. Not one bit, Biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tall chief with a drooping feathered headdress
and a plumed belt had taken charge, and was ordering
Nara and the Wai Wais from their boats. Nara&rsquo;s
Indians brought their machetes, but old Joe came
entirely unarmed. He jabbered dialect at the feathered
chief. Then, finding that he didn&rsquo;t understand, Nara
let Igo and Ubi take over as interpreters.</p>
<p>After a brief talk, Nara turned to Mr. Brewster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are Maco Indians,&rdquo; stated Nara. &ldquo;They were
told that we intend to attack their village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macus,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s father groaned. &ldquo;I knew they would
catch up with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Macus,&rdquo; corrected Nara. &ldquo;<i>Macos</i>, who live on
the upper Orinoco. But they can be just as dangerous,
now that they&rsquo;re sure we are their enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they get that idea?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Brewster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From three men who stopped at their village near
the Casiquiare,&rdquo; explained Nara, &ldquo;and told them that
we would come sneaking through the backwaters to
the spot where we are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serbot, Pepito, and Urubu,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster decided
grimly. &ldquo;It must have been Pepito who stole the map
in Manaus. They were unable to locate the mine on
their portion of it, but they cut across our route and
stirred up this tribe against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; put in Whitman. &ldquo;Give
them presents and send them away happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be happy unless they take us, too,&rdquo; declared
Nara. &ldquo;They want us to accompany them to
their village, so that their king can hear our story. He
will decide whether we are guilty or innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means he will either find us guilty,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Brewster, &ldquo;or he&rsquo;ll put us through some ordeal
where we will come out more dead than alive. Should
we make a stand for it here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; returned Nara. &ldquo;Those spear tips
are already poisoned. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re boiling
water, to cook up a new brew after they&rsquo;ve used
their spears. One false move now, and we&rsquo;re goners.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>From the bristling appearance of the spears and
the glares of the two dozen spearmen who now surrounded
the party, it looked as though Nara was right.
Impatient mutters were coming from the tribesmen
while the feathered chief awaited a reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t fight them,&rdquo; declared Mr. Brewster, &ldquo;and
we can&rsquo;t go with them. What choice does that leave
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one,&rdquo; replied Nara calmly. &ldquo;We must convince
them that we have a right to be here, more right,
in fact, than they have.&rdquo; He turned to Ubi and Igo and
announced importantly: &ldquo;Tell them who I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Igo and Ubi babbled in dialect with the title &ldquo;El
Dorado&rdquo; sprinkled through it, bringing echoing exclamations
of &ldquo;El Dorado&rdquo; from the Maco tribesmen.
At the finish, Igo spoke simply to Nara:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say they like to see you show them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show them!&rdquo; Nara made a spreading gesture
with his arms. &ldquo;Tell them to clear the way to that big
pot up there by the fire, and I&rsquo;ll show them I&rsquo;m El
Dorado!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Igo translated the statement, the Maco chief ordered
his followers to clear a path, which they did.
Old Joe Nara strode forward, nodding his head as
though his triumph was already assured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Kamuka, &ldquo;that Senhor Nara can
do something to help, like real El Dorado would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever he does,&rdquo; added Biff fervently, &ldquo;it will
have to be good, if it&rsquo;s going to help at all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />The Man of Gold</h2>
<p>When Joe Nara reached the big campfire, he extended
his hands above the simmering kettle and swept
them back and forth in slow, impressive fashion. His
back was toward the half-circle of tribesmen, but now,
he changed position.</p>
<p>First to the right, then to the left of the fire, Nara
repeated his odd ritual. Finally, he stepped beyond the
fire and turned to face the group through the rising
steam which wavered and curled about his arms as
he repeated his ceremony.</p>
<p>Two savage spearmen had stepped up to flank him
with poised weapons, but Nara paid them no attention.
Biff looked slowly around and saw that he and
his father were under similar guard. So were Kamuka
and Hal Whitman, as well as Jacome and the other
natives. Whatever Nara might do, there would be no
chance to make a run for the boats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Now Nara was drawing his shirt sleeves clear up
past his elbows. He looked like a wizened wizard as he
showed one bare arm and then the other, holding his
upraised hands with widespread fingers. Looking toward
the sun, which was almost overhead, Nara made
a clutching motion with his right hand; then a downward
throw toward the kettle, as though flinging
blobs of sunlight into the bubbling liquid.</p>
<p>Then, he boldly drove his right arm shoulder deep
into the kettle, keeping it there while he stirred the
boiling water with his bare arm. The tribesmen
began an excited babble when they realized that Nara
was unharmed. It became a shout when Nara brought
his hand from the kettle and raised it high, for all to
see.</p>
<p>From fingertips to above his elbow, Nara&rsquo;s hand
and arm glittered like burnished gold, catching the
sparkle of the sunlight which he had seemingly captured
to transform his flesh into that precious metal.
Now the tribesmen were shouting recognition:</p>
<p>&ldquo;El Dorado! El Dorado!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nara apparently had turned legend into fact. To
prove his power, he repeated the process with his left
arm. He showed it bare and white, dipped it deep into
the hissing water and brought it out all golden like his
right.</p>
<p>The cry of &ldquo;El Dorado! El Dorado!&rdquo; increased as
Nara stalked among the Maco tribesmen, showing
them his hands and arms at close range. The warriors
were awed, from their chief down to the pair of spearmen
who were supposed to keep Nara a prisoner&mdash;something
which they had now forgotten in their
amazement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>The Wai Wais remained silent. Igo, Ubi, and Nara&rsquo;s
other followers had seen him perform this wonder.
They took his power for granted. Now, at a word
from Nara, Igo and Ubi gathered up small pebbles
which they showed to the Maco tribesmen.</p>
<p>Nara went back to the big kettle, and there he took
pebbles first from Igo, then from Ubi, promptly dipping
them in the bubbling brew. As he brought out
the pebbles, he held them in the sunlight, showing
them to be pure gold. Nara gave the magic stones to
Igo and Ubi to distribute among the Maco warriors,
who crowded forward to receive the gifts.</p>
<p>Biff found himself practically alone beside his father.
In an awed tone, Biff asked, &ldquo;How did Nara work
that trick, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stirred the water to reduce its temperature,&rdquo; explained
Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;It had begun to boil at the top,
but was still cool below. I&rsquo;ve seen the Fiji Islanders do
a similar stunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did he turn his hands and arms all
golden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With some dye, probably, that he dropped into the
water while he was making passes over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t see how he managed to fool those natives
into thinking that those colored pebbles are real
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are real gold,&rdquo; Biff&rsquo;s father stated, with a
smile. &ldquo;Remember all those nuggets that Nara carries?
I think he has been palming them from his pockets.
Every time he dips a pebble into the kettle, he lets it
drop and brings out a nugget instead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Biff watched Nara give the dip treatment to a few
more pebbles, then nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right, Dad,&rdquo; said Biff, &ldquo;but Nara
is mighty clever at it. Only why is he handing out so
many nuggets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To buy our freedom, son,&rdquo; returned Mr. Brewster.
&ldquo;Look. Nara is bargaining with the chief right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nuggets apparently weren&rsquo;t enough, for the
Maco chief was shaking his head emphatically. Nara
promptly came up with a much bigger offer. He
picked some stones the size of hen&rsquo;s eggs and began
passing them among the tribesmen, who nodded
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nara can&rsquo;t possibly be carrying nuggets the size
of those stones,&rdquo; declared Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d
weigh him down so he couldn&rsquo;t walk. Get ready now
to run for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff passed the word to Kamuka, who relayed it to
Whitman. By then, the Maco chief had accepted the
ransom offer, but wanted the big stones turned to
gold. Nara went to the kettle, pretended to throw in
more fistfuls of sunlight, then turned to the chief and
made a beckoning gesture, as he cackled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Headed by the chief, the tribesmen made a charge
for the magic kettle, all anxious to turn their stones
into gold before the pot ran out of concentrated sunlight.
Nara stepped away to let them pass, then waved
for Mr. Brewster and the rest to begin their own dash
the opposite way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>They raced for the boats and were clambering on
board, with Nara only a few yards behind them, when
the milling tribesmen noticed their flight. Still, the
natives were too busy to be bothered until they found
that the stones refused to turn to gold. Then they
threw them down and grabbed up their spears instead,
but by that time the motors were spinning and the
boats were under way, with Igo hauling Nara over
the side of their <i>monteria</i> while Ubi handled the helm.</p>
<p>Some of the natives started a pursuit in their canoes,
but the outboards soon outdistanced them. All seemed
safe and serene during the next half hour, while they
followed deep though sometimes narrow channels.
Then, from far in the jungle behind them, came the
<i>bom-bom-bom</i> of a savage drum.</p>
<p>Nara signaled for the boats to draw together for a
conference. In a worried tone, old Joe announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maco drums. You can hear them for thirty or forty
miles. They are telling other tribes to be on the watch
for us. So be ready for trouble.&rdquo; He paused, then asked
Mr. Brewster in a low, confidential tone, &ldquo;How did
you like the golden arm trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;But these natives
use paints themselves to color their faces and
bodies, so I can&rsquo;t understand how you fooled them
with a dye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff was close enough to hear Nara&rsquo;s chuckle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t use dye,&rdquo; Nara stated. &ldquo;I used a fine powder
made from dried plants, sprinkled with tiny flakes
of gilt, that spreads on the water like a dust. Dip your
hand in and bring it out, the stuff gathers and clings
like a snug rubber glove. After it dries, you wipe it
off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p005.jpg" alt="Canoes on the river" width="500" height="523" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Nara showed his hands, now perfectly clean; then
added, &ldquo;I sprinkled just about enough for myself, so
those Indians didn&rsquo;t get any on their own hands. They
still think that I alone have the golden touch, but even
my being El Dorado won&rsquo;t help us now that they feel
I robbed them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="Drummers" width="500" height="625" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>An hour later, the drums were still throbbing when
Joe Nara pointed above the jungle to a huge, flat-topped
mountain that towered like a mighty mesa
above the wavy green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cerro Duida,&rdquo; called Nara, from his boat. &ldquo;One of
the biggest mountains in the Parima chain, about a mile
and a half high. It was a long time before anybody
climbed it, because Indians are afraid to go with them,
on account of the spirits they think live on top. It&rsquo;s
kind of tied in with the El Dorado story. Anyway,
Cerro Duida is close to the Orinoco River&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nara broke off as some canoes came scooting from
the canal banks, filled with armed natives. Motors
were opened to the full, and the flotilla again outdistanced
the native dugouts. But Biff, at the bow of
his father&rsquo;s <i>monteria</i>, saw new problems ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve missed the main channel, Dad,&rdquo; Biff called
to the stem. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s shallow ahead, with a lot of sandbars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster cut off his motor and signaled for the
other boats to do the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better pole our way through,&rdquo; he decided.
&ldquo;We still have time before those natives catch up with
us, and we can&rsquo;t risk getting stranded on a sandbar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch where you push pole,&rdquo; Kamuka advised
Biff. &ldquo;Big <i>sucuria</i> may wrap around it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>As Kamuka pointed, Biff saw a huge anaconda
lazily sunning itself on a sandbar near the canal bank.
Beyond that were others; in fact, the area was alive
with the giant snakes, though none appeared to be
active.</p>
<p>Carefully, the boats were poled through the channels
without disturbing the basking boas. Biff looked
back and counted a dozen of them, still in repose.
Snakes as well as shallows had been avoided, when
Nara&rsquo;s boat ran on a hidden sandbar that the others
had crossed. With its heavy cargo of ore, Nara&rsquo;s <i>monteria</i>
refused to budge.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster attached lines to Nara&rsquo;s boat, so that
the others could haul it free. He told everybody to
pole at once, and his plan seemed certain of success,
when Nara shrilled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look back there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Native canoes had come around the bend. Seeing
the flotilla stuck among the sandbars, the tribesmen
increased their paddle strokes. Nara grabbed a rifle
and shouted to Mr. Brewster:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your boats clear! I&rsquo;ll fight them off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep going!&rdquo; ordered Mr. Brewster. Then, to
Nara, he called: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start shooting! They outnumber
us ten to one, and those spears of theirs have poison
tips. Once they start throwing them, we won&rsquo;t have a
chance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was too late. Joe Nara couldn&rsquo;t be stopped, once
his mind was made up. He opened fire at the canoes
when they reached the first sandbar. Two dozen warriors
rose to fling their deadly spears!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />Urubu Again</h2>
<p>With the first crackle of Nara&rsquo;s rifle, Mr. Brewster
shouted, &ldquo;Down everybody&mdash;and get ready for them!&rdquo;
That, Biff knew, could be more than just a shower
of spears. The warriors themselves would be arriving
next, with other weapons. The only hope would be a
few more pole thrusts, but while that might save some
of the party, it wouldn&rsquo;t help Joe Nara.</p>
<p>It happened though, that Nara had helped himself.
Those crazy shots that peppered the sandbars without
coming near a canoe, unleashed a terrific force that
took the native warriors by complete surprise. As
they poised their spears, the sandbanks sprang into
life before their eyes.</p>
<p>Roused by the blasts of Nara&rsquo;s guns and the ping of
the bullets in their sandy sunning spot, the anacondas
lashed their way straight downstream in a broad horde
of writhing fury that seemed to stretch like a monstrous
ribbon, two hundred feet in length.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>The stampede of mighty boa constrictors swept
everything from their path. Their thick bodies and
lashing coils spilled the canoes and plunged the native
warriors into the canal, spears and all.</p>
<p>The snakes didn&rsquo;t stop their mad rush. They
whacked natives as well as boats when they passed
them and left the canoes drifting in a churn of foam
that made the canal look like a rapids clear beyond
the bend. Then the living tidal wave was gone as
quickly as it had begun. But Mr. Brewster wasn&rsquo;t waiting
for the natives to reclaim their canoes and spears
so as to return to action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to the poles!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Heave away&mdash;away,
everybody&mdash;and you, too, Nara!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Joe, his face gleaming in happy surprise at the
thing he had touched off, now laid aside his rifle and
helped pry the barge from its sandy perch. By the
time the hostile tribesmen were wading up on the
sandbars that the anacondas had left, Nara&rsquo;s boat was
free. Outboards roared anew as the flotilla plowed its
way to the main channel and on to the junction of
the Casquiare and the Orinoco, where they headed
downstream.</p>
<p>The rhythmic beat of distant tom-toms could still be
heard that evening, when the motors were stopped and
the boats allowed to drift down the river under a
brilliant tropical moon. By morning, the drums had
ceased, indicating that the Maco tribe had either given
up the chase or that the flotilla was beyond the danger
zone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>From then on, the expedition traveled mostly by
day and picked suitable campsites overnight. Biff and
Kamuka fished frequently and replenished the food
supply by catching huge river turtles as well as a tasty
species of catfish called <i>cajaro</i>. Biff landed one that
measured well over three feet in length.</p>
<p>Some nights, the boats were lashed side by side and
moored near river settlements where they formed
what Hal Whitman termed a &ldquo;floating mansion,&rdquo; complete
to the kitchen. At one village, Joe Nara bought
stacks of huge cassava cakes. These measured two and
a half feet across, but were only a half-inch thick.
They had been brought upriver wrapped in plantain
leaves.</p>
<p>These formed the main food for the Wai Wais accompanying
Nara, and Jacome and Kamuka liked
them too, though Biff found them rather tasteless. In
contrast were some cayman eggs, which the boys dug
up on a sandy shore while hunting turtles with Jacome.
The Indians, Kamuka included, found them tasty
indeed, but they were too strong in flavor to suit Biff.</p>
<p>Caymans were the great menace of the Orinoco,
so the boys were duly warned against them. Closely
resembling alligators, they were supposed to measure
twenty-five feet or more in length. But when Kamuka
called, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big one!&rdquo; and Mr. Brewster
promptly drilled it with a rifle shot, the cayman
measured only twelve feet, when it was hauled on
board the kitchen <i>monteria</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you see a creature in motion,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster
told the boys, &ldquo;and particularly a bird, or its cousin, a
reptile, you always gain an exaggerated idea of its
length.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eggs-aggerate?&rdquo; Kamuka repeated the unfamiliar
term. &ldquo;You mean eggs look long too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not eggs-actly,&rdquo; put in Biff, with a smile, &ldquo;but
if we&rsquo;d looked much longer at those cayman eggs, they
would have hatched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster smiled at the jokes, then became serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must learn what it means to gauge speed in
terms of distance,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;When we reach the
rapids where the Ventuari flows into the Orinoco, you
boys can take the boat down through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the rapids, Mr. Brewster gave
the helm to Biff, then told Kamuka to mind the bow
and watch for rocks. Mr. Brewster went into the
thatched cabin, but from there, he kept a sharp lookout
in case the boys ran into trouble.</p>
<p>Biff realized that his dad was standing by in case of
emergency, but unless something of the sort developed,
Biff knew he would be on his own. What a
thrill it was!</p>
<p>Kamuka watched like a cat, to copy any move made
by Jacome and the stolid natives who were warding
off rocks from the bows of the other boats. Biff kept
an eager eye on Whitman, Joe Nara, and the Wai Wai
who was piloting the kitchen barge. When Biff saw
that they were watching the man in the bow, he did
the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Time and again, Kamuka would raise his paddle to
jab at a threatening rock. Always, Biff handled the
helm accordingly. Kamuka nodded his head admiringly.
He was crediting Biff with being a wonderful
pilot, never realizing that he was furnishing the tip-off
that enabled his friend to demonstrate such skill.</p>
<p>Twice, though, it was Kamuka&rsquo;s quick work with
the paddle that staved off a crash on the rocks before
Biff could bring the helm about. When at last they
were drifting in the calm water below the rapids,
Biff sprang forward over the thatched cabin and
grabbed Kamuka&rsquo;s hand, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great work, Kamuka! We make a perfect team!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka smiled solemnly as he repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We make&mdash;perfect team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster came from the cabin and clapped a
hand on each boy&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do make a perfect team,&rdquo; he complimented.
&ldquo;Just remember it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They remembered it, several nights later, when they
sat around the campfire after a <i>cajaro</i> dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; stated Mr. Brewster, &ldquo;we come to the
Maipures Rapids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we take the boat down through them?&rdquo; queried
Biff. &ldquo;I mean, Kamuka and I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of our boats will shoot the Maipures,&rdquo; said
Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;They are impassable. So are the rapids
of the Atures, forty miles below. A road has been built
around both rapids, so that trucks can transport us
with our boats.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Joe Nara gave a high-pitched snort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where Serbot will be waiting for us,&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; put in Hal Whitman. &ldquo;After he
sold us out to those Indians on the Casquiare, he probably
headed back the other way, down the Rio
Negro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he figured we&rsquo;d be coming down the
Orinoco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitman and Nara both turned to Mr. Brewster,
to see if he could settle the argument. As he lighted his
pipe, Mr. Brewster stated calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about an even chance that Serbot came this
way. If he did, he will probably be watching the road
to see if we come through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; declared Nara. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better keep
a sharp lookout when we reach that portage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serbot may be watching for us,&rdquo; agreed Mr.
Brewster, &ldquo;but he won&rsquo;t be able to make trouble for
us there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what he&rsquo;s already done,&rdquo; argued Nara, &ldquo;he
might give us trouble anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached Sanariapo, the tiny village at
the head of the upper rapids, Biff and Kamuka noticed
some natives watching Igo and Ubi carry sacks of ore
up over the sloping rock between the river and the
highway, where transport trucks were waiting to load
the boats as well as the cargo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>The boys reported this to Biff&rsquo;s father, who talked
with the truck drivers and learned that the hangers-on
were simply hoping to pick up a few <i>bolivars</i> in Venezuelan
money by helping load the trucks. But that
didn&rsquo;t satisfy Joe Nara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they can&rsquo;t make a <i>bolivar</i> one way,&rdquo; he argued,
&ldquo;they may try another. Like telling people about our
gold ore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here at Sanariapo,&rdquo; stated Mr. Brewster, &ldquo;there
is no one for them to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might pass the word along to Puerto Ayacucho,
below the lower rapids,&rdquo; returned Nara. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
ahead on the first truck with Igo and Ubi, so I can
check on any rumors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took most of the day to make trucking arrangements,
and to transport boats as well as cargo over the
modern highway that spans the intervening streams
on big steel bridges. Biff found the trip interesting,
with stretches of open country and barren hills as well
as wooded slopes and forested areas.</p>
<p>The highway followed the right bank of the Orinoco,
which belongs to Venezuela, while the land on
the other side of the river is part of the Republic of
Colombia. At Puerto Ayacucho, they found Igo and
Ubi waiting to load the ore sacks into Nara&rsquo;s <i>monteria</i>,
when it arrived. But there was no sign of Nara.</p>
<p>According to Igo and Ubi, Nara had gone somewhere
immediately after arriving in Puerto Ayacucho.
But Mr. Brewster, inquiring at stores, hotels, and
elsewhere, was unable to find anyone who had even
seen the old white-haired prospector.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;The only place left,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster declared,
chuckling, &ldquo;is the governor&rsquo;s office. Maybe Joe Nara
is having lunch with His Excellency. Should we try
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; returned Hal Whitman dryly.
&ldquo;From the way Nara looks for trouble, we might do
better if we asked at the local calaboose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster smiled at that reference to the town
jail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already asked there,&rdquo; he said. Then, turning
to the boys, he added, &ldquo;Look around for Nara, and if
you don&rsquo;t have any luck, I guess we&rsquo;ll have to call on
the governor&rsquo;s office to help us find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka noticed some natives lounging near an old
shack on the high bank of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they have seen Senhor Nara,&rdquo; Kamuka said
to Biff. &ldquo;But you will have to ask them. They do not
speak Portuguese as I do. They talk Spanish, which
you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they approached the group, Biff addressed
the nearest native, who was huddled by the wall, his
chin buried deep in his red bandanna neckerchief and
his gaze turned toward the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oiga, amigo</i>,&rdquo; began Biff. &ldquo;<i>Soy buscando un viejo
son pelo bianco</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff was saying that he was looking for an old man
with white hair, but he got no further. The slouchy
native came to his feet and spun about with a snarl.</p>
<p>As Biff dropped back, he found himself staring into
the vicious, hawkish face of Urubu!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />Partners in Crime</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Biff! He may have a knife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warning came from Kamuka as the Indian boy
grabbed Biff&rsquo;s arm, hauling him away from Urubu. But
there was no way for them to dodge, except toward
the wall, as Urubu was between them and the corner
of the building.</p>
<p>Then, from around that very corner came a limber
figure, a thin man clad in dungarees and a big sombrero,
whose tight fists moved like pistons as they
jabbed at Urubu&rsquo;s face. Jolted backward, Urubu
dropped the knife that he was pulling from beneath
his shirt. Warding off a few blows, he turned and ran
wildly for a landing below the riverbank.</p>
<p>The boys turned to thank their rescuer, who had
lost his big sombrero and was stooping to pick up the
wide-brimmed hat. They were amazed when they
saw his smiling face and white hair. The man who
had routed Urubu was Joe Nara.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;The way to spot snoopers,&rdquo; advised Nara, &ldquo;is to
go snooping for them. Nobody would know old
Joe Nara in this outfit, particularly with his white
hair out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nara chuckled as he put on the sombrero, showing
how quick and complete the change was. Then
Nara pointed to the river where a small, squat motorboat
was scudding downstream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes Urubu,&rdquo; said Nara, &ldquo;with another rat
who was waiting for him, probably Pepito. They&rsquo;re
going to tell their boss Serbot that the gold rush is
coming his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys couldn&rsquo;t see the boat closely, because they
faced the glare of the late afternoon sun. When they
told Mr. Brewster what had happened, he agreed
with Nara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep going downstream, though,&rdquo; Mr.
Brewster decided, &ldquo;until we reach the rapids above
Puerto Carreno, the only town on the Colombian
side of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we go through those rapids?&rdquo; asked Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are quite navigable,&rdquo; his father replied,
&ldquo;but that is where Serbot and his crew will be waiting
to attack us. If we get by the rapids, we&rsquo;ll be all
right, because Mr. Stannart should be at Puerto Carreno
in his yacht, by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he come that far up the Orinoco, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he can make it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;And
in his letter he said he would, unless we met him
farther downriver. Since we have taken longer than
the time he allotted us, we should find him there.
Then we&rsquo;ll close the mining deal with you, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we get there,&rdquo; put in Nara glumly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
go around those rapids unless we take a back trail,
and Serbot will be watching that, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the loaded flotilla continued down the river,
Mr. Brewster continued to weigh the coming problem.
He was hoping that a solution might crop up,
and as the expedition approached the rapids, the answer
came.</p>
<p>Back from the river on the Venezuelan side stood
an old, abandoned blockhouse flanked by a few dilapidated
mud huts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make camp there,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster decided.
&ldquo;We can bring enough supplies into the blockhouse
to hold Serbot off if he tries to attack us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he has spies watching for us now?&rdquo;
asked Biff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very probably,&rdquo; his father rejoined. &ldquo;And when
he learns that we aren&rsquo;t coming down the river, he
will have to come up here to find us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster signaled the other boats to shore,
and when they landed, he explained full details of his
plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, Nara,&rdquo; stated Mr. Brewster, &ldquo;I want
you to move your Wai Wai Indians down by a back
trail to the rapids. They should be able to creep up
on Serbot&rsquo;s crew without his knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nara nodded agreement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as Serbot becomes impatient and starts
up here,&rdquo; Mr. Brewster went on, &ldquo;the Wai Wais
can spring a surprise attack on any men that he leaves
there. Then, before Serbot has time to attack us
here, we&rsquo;ll come down the river in the boats. We&rsquo;ll
pick your men up at the rapids, where they will have
cleared the way for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about my <i>monteria</i>?&rdquo; asked Nara, tilting
his head in canny style. &ldquo;It has all the gold ore.
Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring it with the other boats,&rdquo; promised
Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;It means more to me than to you,
Nara, because you have lots more back at El Dorado.
But these are the samples that I need to show Mr.
Stannart and close the deal for Ajax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose Serbot does attack here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drive him off from the blockhouse. When
he sees that we are well fortified, he is sure to withdraw
until he can bring up more men. Your Wai
Wais will have taken care of them. That&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll
surprise him by dashing out to the boats and starting
down the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spent the rest of the day bringing the supplies
in from the boats and putting the blockhouse
into shape. The small windows of the square, squatty
building were equipped with screens, but most of
them were in poor condition. Mr. Brewster insisted
upon repairing them first.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get fortified against mosquitoes and other
insects for tonight,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;During the evening,
we can strengthen the shutters and fix loopholes
so as to fight off Serbot and his pests tomorrow or
whenever they come this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the others worked late into the evening, Joe
Nara strode about wearing a gun belt with two revolvers
poking from its holsters, ready for trouble.
Later Nara and his Wai Wais slept under netting on
their <i>monterias</i>, so as to get a good rest.</p>
<p>In the blockhouse, the other members of the party
took turns at guard duty through the night. At dawn,
Jacome awakened Biff, who was scheduled to take
over at that time. From one of the screened windows,
Biff saw the squatty figures of Igo and Ubi emerge
from Nara&rsquo;s <i>monteria</i>. They roused the other Indians,
and soon were stealthily moving off among the trees,
to seek a trail to the rapids.</p>
<p>The next few hours were the longest that Biff had
ever experienced. The others woke up, had breakfast,
and strolled about the camp. But the very air seemed
charged with expectancy. It would probably be mid-afternoon,
perhaps even later in the day, before a
move came from the other camp&mdash;if a move came at
all.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster, Hal Whitman, and Jacome were all
carrying their rifles, fully loaded, but that was purely
a matter of precaution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nara&rsquo;s party can&rsquo;t have reached the rapids yet,&rdquo;
Mr. Brewster told Biff and Kamuka. &ldquo;Even so, they
won&rsquo;t make a move unless Serbot starts out with
his main force. If he sends some men ahead, they
may try some sniping so, naturally, we must be ready.
But that will show their hand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden interruption came from the surrounding
trees, the blasts of a dozen guns or more. Mr.
Brewster wheeled and fired back from the spot where
he was standing, midway between the blockhouse and
the boats. Mr. Whitman and Jacome were nearer the
blockhouse. They turned and fired, too.</p>
<p>A bigger volley answered from a wider angle, accompanied
by the whine of bullets that were high,
but close. Whitman was shouting from near the
blockhouse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way! Quick, or you&rsquo;ll be cut off! Serbot is
here with his whole outfit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amid new gunbursts, Mr. Brewster made a rapid
decision. He pointed the boys to the shore and told
them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! Get to Nara&rsquo;s <i>monteria</i>. Start it down
the river, and don&rsquo;t stop until you reach Stannart&rsquo;s
yacht!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were on their way, and Mr. Brewster
was dashing back to the blockhouse, to join Whitman
and Jacome. He made it safely, although he
drew the fire of Serbot&rsquo;s followers, who were now
visible as they came clambering, shouting, from the
surrounding brush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>But Biff and Kamuka were now beyond the range
of immediate gunfire when they boarded the
<i>monteria</i>. Then they had the big motor started, and
the heavily loaded boat was plowing its way out to
the middle of the Orinoco.</p>
<p>When Biff looked back, he saw tiny figures on the
shore, but the boat was now half a mile away, too far
for bullets to reach it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serbot staged a surprise attack of his own,&rdquo; Biff
told Kamuka, who was with him in the stem. &ldquo;And
Dad had promised Nara that he would get this
<i>monteria</i> down the river. So here we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon we reach rapids,&rdquo; was Kamuka&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;I better get ready so we can work like team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The space under the thatched cabin was stacked
with packs as well as sacks of ore, so Kamuka didn&rsquo;t
try to crawl through it to reach the bow of the boat.
Instead, he scrambled over the low roof, picked up a
paddle from the forward cockpit, and waved back to
Biff as he took his position.</p>
<p>Soon the white foam of the rapids showed ahead.
Biff steered for what looked like the main channel,
and the <i>monteria</i> was swept into a series of whirlpools
that licked the sides of jutting black rocks. The
contrast in color helped Kamuka ward off those
obstacles, while Biff did some fancy piloting to keep
to the channel.</p>
<p>Then, as Biff veered from a new hazard in the
shape of a sandbank, he saw what he had feared most.
Human figures rose from the tall grass beyond the
sandy shoal and aimed rifles directly at the swift-moving
boat and the boys who manned it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>They were Serbot&rsquo;s reserves, Biff realized, stationed
here to block the flotilla if it came down the rapids,
and Biff was sure he saw the gleaming face of Urubu
in the midst of the group. Urubu was finding it an
easy task with only a single <i>monteria</i> coming his way.
He waved his hand as a signal to fire.</p>
<p>As the rifles barked, Biff gunned the motor, adding
enough speed to carry the boat from the path of fire.
But Urubu&rsquo;s crew was aiming again, this time at
point-blank range. Fortunately their fire never
came. The tall grass stirred behind them, and from
it sprang Igo, Ubi, and the rest of Nara&rsquo;s Indians.</p>
<p>The Wai Wais had been stalking Urubu&rsquo;s riflemen
to the edge of the sandbank. The first blast of gunfire
had given away the position of Urubu&rsquo;s men.
Now, the Wai Wais were engulfing them like a human
tidal wave, while Biff and Kamuka resumed their
battle with the rapids, keeping the big, clumsy boat
clear of the rocks and sand.</p>
<p>Finally, the water subsided, and they were chugging
peacefully down the river past the little settlement
of Puerto Carreno and a great jutting point of
sand where the Meta River flowed in from the left
to join the Orinoco.</p>
<p>Kamuka waved his paddle and pointed ahead.
Moored well away from the channel was a sleek
white craft that could only be Mr. Stannart&rsquo;s yacht,
the <i>Coronet</i>. Though small, it had a trim build that
marked it seaworthy, capable of braving the Caribbean,
yet also suited to river travel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Smiling men in trim uniforms appeared on deck
as Biff maneuvered the <i>monteria</i> alongside the yacht.
The boys made their boat fast and clambered up a
rope ladder to find Mr. Stannart coming from his
cabin to greet them. Biff introduced Kamuka, then
started to pour out his story in one breath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s upriver in a lot of trouble. Old Joe Nara is
somewhere along the rapids. But we&rsquo;ve brought the
gold ore from the mine, down there in the boat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stannart smilingly interrupted with a wave
toward the cabin as he suggested:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step in there and tell me all about it. I have a
friend who would like to hear it too. You will agree
when you meet him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys entered the compact cabin, then stopped
short in amazement. Mr. Stannart&rsquo;s friend was smiling,
too, but in a way that was anything but pleasant.
For both Biff and Kamuka had seen that fixed smile
before.</p>
<p>The man who awaited them in the cabin was Nicholas
Serbot!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />The Tables Turn</h2>
<p>Gripped by utter astonishment, Biff could only stare
from Serbot to Stannart. When he found his voice, he
blurted out accusingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two must have been working together from
the very start!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; declared Mr. Stannart dryly, &ldquo;although
I must say that Mr. Serbot and I have continually operated
along similar lines. However, it wasn&rsquo;t until after
your father told the Ajax Corporation about Lew
Kirby and his wonderful mine that I even heard of
Nicholas Serbot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; rejoined Serbot, with his same fixed smile,
&ldquo;had never heard of the Ajax Mining Corporation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the fact that your father was impressed
by Kirby&rsquo;s story,&rdquo; Stannart told Biff, &ldquo;Ajax still had to
investigate it. Kirby had samples of gold that might
have come from many places, and his map could have
meant nothing. It was necessary to obtain some reports
from the upper region of the Rio Negro. I learned
that certain European interests were checking on the
same story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; added Serbot, &ldquo;happened to represent
some of those interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So while the directors of the Ajax Corporation
dawdled,&rdquo; continued Stannart, &ldquo;I contacted the competition.
I had much to offer that they needed, as Mr.
Serbot will agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Serbot, &ldquo;advised them to meet the
price, which included&mdash;this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By &ldquo;this&rdquo; Serbot referred to the stolen portion of
Kirby&rsquo;s map, which he spread on the desk in front of
him. Biff started to say something, then caught himself.
Gregg Stannart recognized what was in Biff&rsquo;s mind
and promptly expressed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I needed a go-between,&rdquo; Stannart asserted. &ldquo;Some
way to enable Serbot to use the information I could
give him without bringing suspicion on myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you gave me that letter!&rdquo; exclaimed Biff. He
turned accusingly toward Serbot. &ldquo;And you tried to
steal it from me on the plane! It was all arranged beforehand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All very nicely arranged,&rdquo; agreed Stannart, &ldquo;because
I wanted to keep my job with Ajax if the El
Dorado story proved to be a hoax.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Since I might have seen the address on the envelope
you carried,&rdquo; Serbot told Biff, &ldquo;you and your father
guessed that I sent Pepito to steal your precious map,
which was exactly what I wanted. What you didn&rsquo;t
guess was that Stannart was in on the game. The funniest
part&rdquo;&mdash;for once, Serbot&rsquo;s smile seemed real&mdash;&ldquo;was
that I had a carbon copy of Stannart&rsquo;s letter to
your father, here in my pocket all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff swelled with indignation until he happened to
glance toward Kamuka. All this talk had left Kamuka
totally unimpressed. In Kamuka&rsquo;s eyes, Biff saw
only the same appeal that had been present that day
when Biff had pulled the other boy from the quicksand.
Biff suddenly realized that now they both were
in something equally deep and probably just as deadly.
Since he couldn&rsquo;t say anything that would help, Biff
said nothing.</p>
<p>Stannart turned to Serbot and put the question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should we do with these boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; returned Serbot harshly. &ldquo;Maybe
they should have upset their boat and drowned, coming
down through those rapids. If something like that
had happened&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Stannart interrupted. &ldquo;Your men will
have taken care of Brewster and his party by now.
But we still need the boys to help us. Suppose we take
them up the river, as far as the torn portion of your
map&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stannart was leaning forward, pointing to the map
with one hand, but he had his other hand in his pocket,
as though gripping a gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; exclaimed Serbot, who had one hand
in a pocket, too. &ldquo;Then they could take us back to
where they came from, to this El Dorado that Nara
talked about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Both Stannart and Serbot were glaring hard at Biff
as though now it was his turn to speak. Biff&rsquo;s throat
was dry, for he realized that these two men, in their
desire for gold, would think nothing about snuffing
out his life and Kamuka&rsquo;s. Somebody had to speak for
Biff right then&mdash;and somebody did, from the door of
the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody talks about El Dorado,&rdquo; a crackly voice
announced, &ldquo;except Joe Nara, the man who owns it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There in the doorway stood old Joe, both his guns
drawn from their holsters, one fixed on Stannart, the
other on Serbot. At Nara&rsquo;s nod, the two men brought
their hands from their pockets empty. They knew
the old man meant business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty smart, both of you,&rdquo; Nara said. &ldquo;I never
even guessed your game, Stannart, probably because
I never met you before. But having seen you now, I
think I would have known you for a rat from away
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I figured you out, Serbot. I knew what you
were after&mdash;that cargo of mine. So I stayed with
them.&rdquo; Nara gave his head a quick tilt, to smile at Biff
and Kamuka. &ldquo;Yes, boys, I sent my Wai Wais down to
the rapids, while I stayed in the cabin of my <i>monteria</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next thing I knew&rdquo;&mdash;Nara gave a chuckle&mdash;&ldquo;you
were bringing me downriver, and a right good job you
were making of it, too. Finally, you hauled up beside
this yacht and went on board. When you didn&rsquo;t come
back, I reckoned you might be needing old Joe, so
I moseyed on board, and here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still keeping Stannart and Serbot covered with his
guns, Nara shifted his elbow toward his hip pocket to
indicate a coil of rope that projected there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take that rope,&rdquo; Nara told the boys, &ldquo;and tie them
up tight. Gag them, too, with their handkerchiefs. If
they don&rsquo;t have any, use your own. Make a good job
of it. I want them to be here when I send around
for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff and Kamuka followed Nara&rsquo;s instructions
eagerly. They did a good job with the gags, too, while
Nara, brandishing his guns, kept talking to Stannart
and Serbot in an accusing tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figured you out before I ever met you,&rdquo; declared
Nara, &ldquo;because I knew I&rsquo;d be meeting up
with rats some time, and you just happened to be it.
You figured you&rsquo;d get rid of me if you could, and
even if you couldn&rsquo;t you&rsquo;d jump my claim. After all,
who was Joe Nara? Just some crazy guy who thought
he&rsquo;d found El Dorado.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy, yes, but like a fox. I came down the Orinoco
more than once to make sure my claim was registered
after each political shakeup in Venezuela. I
didn&rsquo;t even take any chances on this last trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nara paused, then chuckled as he turned to the boys
who had finished tying Stannart and Serbot in their
chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember how I dropped from sight in Puerto
Ayacucho?&rdquo; asked Nara. &ldquo;Do you know where I
was most of the day? Having lunch with His Excellency,
the governor of the Amazonas Territory,
that&rsquo;s where. I told him some people were trying
to steal my claim. He said he wouldn&rsquo;t let them get
away with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;After I left his office, I snooped around and happened
to be handy when you ran into trouble with
Urubu. I&rsquo;d finished my business with the governor. He
said if he didn&rsquo;t hear from me, he&rsquo;d send some soldiers
downriver to look me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nara examined the knots that the boys had tied and
gave an approving nod. He beckoned them out
through the cabin door, which he closed behind him.
The yacht&rsquo;s crew suspected nothing, for they helped
Nara and the boys over the rail and down into their
waiting <i>monteria</i>.</p>
<p>As they started up the broad Orinoco, Nara
pointed to some boats that were coming toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Government boats,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;bringing those
soldiers I spoke about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they met the boats, they found the other
<i>monterias</i> with them, manned by Biffs father, Mr.
Whitman, and Jacome. The Venezuelan troops had
arrived at the blockhouse during the battle and had
helped rout Serbot&rsquo;s followers, who were commanded
by Pepito.</p>
<p>In the rapids, they had contacted Nara&rsquo;s Wai Wais,
who had overpowered and captured Urubu and his
crew. Igo and Ubi would be along later, Mr. Brewster
stated, bringing their prisoners with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we saw no sign of Serbot,&rdquo; declared Mr.
Brewster. &ldquo;I think we should offer a reward for his
capture. I&rsquo;ll talk to Mr. Stannart about it, when I see
him on the yacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better wait, Dad, till we tell you what happened,&rdquo;
Biff advised soberly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Mr. Brewster was shocked when he heard Biff&rsquo;s
story. &ldquo;I can hardly believe it!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Gregg
Stannart, of all men! But now that I think of it,&rdquo; he
added thoughtfully, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s been a piece missing from
the puzzle right along&mdash;and Stannart was it!&rdquo; He
shook his head. &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Mr. Brewster was more eager than anyone
to take Stannart and Serbot into custody. As they
approached the <i>Coronet</i>, they noticed excitement on
the deck. Mr. Brewster studied the yacht through his
binoculars and announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see Stannart and Serbot, both of them. The crew
must have found them in the cabin and released them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fast boat containing a squad of Venezuelan soldiers
sped ahead to board the yacht. Sight of the
military uniforms must have quenched any desire for
fight in Stannart and Serbot, for suddenly a little
motor launch scooted from the far side of the yacht
and bounded through the choppy waves toward the
left bank of the river.</p>
<p>Only Stannart and Serbot were in the tiny tender.
The boat with the Venezuelan soldiers turned to pursue
it, opening rifle fire, but the fugitives kept on.
Then, just as it seemed sure they would be overtaken,
the chase ended. The soldiers, about to fire at
close range, suddenly lowered their rifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; declared Mr. Brewster glumly. &ldquo;They
can&rsquo;t be captured now. They have passed the middle
of the river and are across the international line, in
Colombian jurisdiction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>The captain of the yacht was astonished when told
the reason for Stannart&rsquo;s flight. He and his crew had
known nothing about Stannart&rsquo;s double-dealing. They
had supposed that Serbot was simply a friend who had
come on board to meet the owner. They had been
puzzled to find the pair bound and gagged after Nara
and the boys had left.</p>
<p>Stannart had claimed that Nara and the boys had
tried to rob him. The yacht captain had accepted that
explanation until Stannart and Serbot saw the Venezuelan
soldiers and suddenly took flight. Then it was
plain that something was wrong.</p>
<p>Contact was made with Caracas, the capital of Venezuela,
and from there, radiograms were relayed to
and from New York. Word finally came from the directors
of the Ajax Mining Corporation, stating that
they had checked their accounts and found that Stannart
had taken most of the available funds before
starting on his Caribbean yacht trip.</p>
<p>The Ajax Corporation obtained an order enabling
them to take over the <i>Coronet</i>, and the yacht was
placed in Mr. Brewster&rsquo;s charge. They also authorized
Mr. Brewster to complete the transaction with Joe
Nara on whatever terms might be mutually satisfactory.</p>
<p>That was done on board the <i>Coronet</i>, which was
still anchored near the junction of the Meta and the
Orinoco. Mr. Brewster set the date when the Ajax
Corporation would take over the mine with a down
payment of a quarter of a million dollars to Joe Nara
and a block of El Dorado stock that would guarantee
him a share of all future profits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>That same day, Joe Nara prepared to start back up
the Orinoco with Igo, Ubi, and the other Wai Wais,
who were eager to rejoin their fellow tribesmen as the
guardians of El Dorado. Hal Whitman arranged to go
along to represent the Ajax Company, taking Jacome
with him. Kamuka packed his few belongings, expecting
to accompany them. The Indian boy was saying
a reluctant good-by to Biff on the deck of the
yacht, when Mr. Brewster quietly commented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go, Kamuka, if you&rsquo;d rather
come with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamuka&rsquo;s eyes popped wide with eager surprise.
Biff showed the same feeling, when he exclaimed,
&ldquo;You really mean it, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Brewster. &ldquo;Hal Whitman told
me he has made plans to send Kamuka to a new school
that is opening in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. But
Hal can&rsquo;t possibly get down there for the next few
weeks, or more. So there&rsquo;s no reason why Kamuka
can&rsquo;t come home with us. Then he can fly to Brasilia
after Mr. Whitman arrives there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff turned and clapped Kamuka on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we have fun, Kamuka! First, the yacht will
take us out into the Atlantic Ocean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of it,&rdquo; put in Kamuka. &ldquo;They say it
is bigger than a thousand Amazons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll see New York, which is more wonderful
than any El Dorado!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>It was hard to tell which boy felt the greater thrill.
Each was glad to continue a companionship in which
they had shared so many adventures, forming the
bonds of a friendship that would last always.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster was the most pleased of all. He stood
at the stem of the yacht with Biff and Kamuka, while
they were churning their way down the broad Orinoco
toward Ciudad Bolivar, the largest port on the
river. It was then that Biff turned to his father and
said, very seriously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, I can&rsquo;t see how Stannart and Serbot missed
out. When they used me as a go-between, they had
everything so easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So easy, Biff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I must have been a big handicap to the safari.
I&rsquo;d never even seen a jungle, let alone run into the sort
of dangers we found there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you learned to meet those dangers, and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes. I certainly did learn some things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so did the rest of us,&rdquo; declared Mr. Brewster.
&ldquo;Our enemies put us in spots where we had to pull one
another out. That was their big mistake. The situations
that we overcame early sharpened us for the problems
we met later. That&rsquo;s why we won out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Biff nodded slowly, his father added with a
smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think back, Biff, and you&rsquo;ll see how it adds up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biff gazed back at the wide Orinoco, tapering to
the dim, distant scenes of those final adventures, and he
knew that his dad was right.</p>

<br />BRAZILIAN GOLD MINE MYSTERY</h3>
<p class="center">By ANDY ADAMS</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard this letter as you would your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words ringing in his ears, Biff
Brewster boards the Brazil-bound plane to
join his father on a safari to the headwaters
of the Amazon River&mdash;a safari that, to
Biff&rsquo;s amazement, becomes a deadly contest
for fabulous riches.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Biff, his father,
Biffs friend Kamuka, and the rest of the
party find their path menaced by an enemy
who never reveals himself. Is it Nicholas
Serbot, the suave stranger whom Biff first
meets on the plane? Or is it Joe Nara, the
eccentric old prospector, the only white
man alive who knows the route to the
almost legendary El Dorado gold mine?</p>
<p>Biff and Kamuka find their days crowded
with the hazards and thrills of jungle
travel as they trek through a wilderness
echoing with the threat of &ldquo;Macu&rdquo;&mdash;the
dreaded head-hunters. And waiting for
them at the end of the trail are a shock
and a surprise beyond their wildest dreams.</p>
<p>Young readers will love this lively, adventure-filled
story with its combination of
realism and fantastic mystery. Here is the
first exciting book in a brand-new series for
boys. Other <span class="sc">Biff Brewster</span> stories are also

</div>
<p>Biff Brewster, sixteen, is a tall, strongly built
blond youth who lives In Indianapolis, Indiana,
with his parents and the eleven-year-old
twins, Ted and Monica. Because his
mother and father believe that travel is as
important to education as formal schooling,
Biff is encouraged to travel to various countries
during the vacation months. His experiences
in these lands, and the young people
he meets there, form the basis of a new series
for adventure-loving readers. In every journey
there is a strong element of mystery, usually a
direct result of conditions peculiar to the region
in which he is traveling. Thus, in addition
to adventure, these books impart carefully researched
information about foreign countries.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
